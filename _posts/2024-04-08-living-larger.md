I once read that for addicts reality distorts so that only once choice is left.

In some weaker form this seems to me like a standard feature of the human condition.

Everyone has a tendency to stick to same, safe stuff over and over again.

There is a natural force that pulls you towards the same places, same people, same ideas, same behaviours.

Humans are creatures of habit and innately risk-averse.

So if you’re not intentional about it, reality will start shrinking, your life will become smaller and smaller, and time accelerates.

There is no stagnation.

Either you’re expanding or contracting.

Every choice either enlarges or diminishes you.

Contraction happens automatically, expansion does not.

Living small is easy.

Living large is not.

Luckily, once you become aware of this, it’s not too hard to turn things around.

For example, a game changer for me has been to have multiple workplaces.

When I work at the exact same spot every day for 10 hours, reality becomes a tunnel. Time flies by.

But with multiple workplaces, a second cowork, the public library, multiple cafes, reality feels much bigger and time slows down.

I’m also getting more important work done, even though working conditions are not always optimal.

When you’re in a tunnel it’s impossible to zoom out and see the bigger picture.

Having a different view in front of you, being surrounded by different people, does help a lot in getting different perspectives on my work.

I’m also dedicating time every week to plan mini adventures.

These “adventures” can be as simple as exploring a new walking path, going to a new restaurant, or buying some paint and painting a picture.

I have a big list titled “Living Larger” where I’m constantly saving ideas.

Each week I pick at least one and schedule it on my calendar.

It doesn’t have to be expensive or crazy, just something different, something I normally don’t do.

In the hustle and bustle of everyday life it’s easy to forget that there are literally infinitely many different things you could be doing at every single moment.

The world is your oyster, you know.
