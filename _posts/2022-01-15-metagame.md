I’m still not sure if I like the term [metagame](https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/).

It definitely makes sense in the context of a game like poker or football. The key to winning in these games at the highest level is not just pure skill but also a proper understanding of strategy. 

You need to understand which strategies are currently popular and then develop a strategy that takes the strategies of all opponents into account. What worked this season probably won’t work next season because all opponents will adapt their strategies accordingly. You need to be at least one step ahead of the competition.

If you’re doing this, you’re playing the metagame.

But what does playing (and winning!) the metagame mean in real-life contexts?

This is not a trivial question since there are no fixed rules or objectives. Games like poker and football are constrained in a way that the real world isn’t. 

They’re [finite games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games), whereas [Grand Theft Life](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) is infinite. 

What playing the metagame means in real life contexts depends on the kind of game you choose to play within this infinite canvas.

For example, a certain type of manager loves to read books by war generals and [muse about](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-use-and-misuse-of-the-ooda-loop) how to “get inside the opponent's OODA loop”. They obviously look at the game of business as something akin to a competitive sport. 

There are rules (laws), there are opponents (competitors), there are strategies. Hence to win you need to study your competitor’s strategies, anticipate their next moves, and then make sure you’re always one step ahead of them. 

If you look at the game of business this way, “playing the metagame” has the exact same meaning as in any other competitive game. 

But, you know, I always thought this is silly. To me, business (like all real-world games worth playing) is a cooperative game. You don’t have to take anything away from anyone to create value. If this wasn’t the case we would all still live in caves. 

Hence any lessons about playing the metagame in the context of traditional games do not really apply. 

There is, however, a slightly different interpretation that makes sense. 

We could, for example, [say that](https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/) “*the metagame of marketing emerges from the fact that all marketing channels decline in efficiency over time.*”

Importantly, this does not happen because some evil opponent is actively sabotaging you. Even if there was only one company that used a specific channel, you’d see diminishing returns. 

It’s simply a law of (human) nature. 

But then, how do you play and win the metagame?

After all, you’re not playing directly against some opponents within the confines of a fixed set of rules. So it makes little sense to become obsessed with their strategies.

Instead, you’re playing *with* thousands of other people in an ever-changing arena that we like to call the market.

With this in mind, here’s how you win the metagame in real life contexts.

First of all, you need to become obsessed with the market. You need to study its history until you’re able to spot patterns and develop an intuition for how it will evolve. 

We already talked about one such pattern. New marketing channels and tactics tend to work well until they’re overcrowded and customers become blind to them.

A second important element of playing the metagame is a strong focus on first principles and the ability to ignore made-up rules. 

[Dead players](https://medium.com/@samo.burja/live-versus-dead-players-2b24f6e9eae2) ([cooks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html)) are busy following scripts, while live players (chefs) are able to do things that haven’t been done before. 

And the only way to make sure you’re not following some invisible script is to go back to the very basics.  Depending on the context this might mean the [laws of physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu), the [laws of human nature](https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Human-Nature-Robert-Greene/dp/0525428143), the laws of biology, the laws of chemistry, the (literal) laws of finance, the rules of, say, football, or a combination of them. 

To summarize:

the recipe for winning at the metagame = **expertise + reasoning from first principles,** 

where you can [substitute](https://commoncog.com/blog/expertise-is-just-pattern-matching/) expertise for pattern matching. 

Here’s an example. If you study the history of marketing, you’ll notice the pattern that certain tactics tend to work on new channels since they’re deeply rooted in human nature. 

For example, roundups tend to work spectacularly well on new platforms (that is, of course, until we start seeing diminishing returns). People love being recognized alongside other important people and will happily help you spread the word. This worked in SEO back in the days, just as it now [works on Twitter](https://twitter.com/heyeaslo/status/1473881057434869763), and will continue to work in the future, although in slightly different forms. 

This is how you stay ahead of the curve and ultimately win.

PS: I analysed what “playing the metagame” means in real-world contexts by looking at two specific extremal cases. We talked about business as a purely competitive game and as a purely cooperative game. 

While this is a [valid method to explore the lay of the land](http://streetfightingmath.com), to most people real-world games are both competitive and cooperative. (And, of course, to [some](https://twitter.com/navalbot/status/1055534617225322502?lang=en) it’s all a single player game.)

For example, the speed at which you see diminishing returns in a marketing channel depends on the behavior of everyone else who uses it. Moreover, it’s reasonable to argue that we’re all competing for the same limited amount of attention. (Although looking at the [many subtle ways ads can have an impact](https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/), might lead to a slightly different picture.)

However, the recipe for winning at the metagame generalizes to both extremal cases, everything in between and also works for traditional games.
