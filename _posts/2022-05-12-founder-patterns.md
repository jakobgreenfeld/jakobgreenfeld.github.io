The main difference between experienced and less experienced founders is that they have larger repertoire of patterns to refer to. Call them frameworks, patterns, whatever. 

When the initial excitement fades, beginners start to panic but experienced founders know that this is just the usual trough of sorrow and stay focused. 

And the good news is that you don’t have to figure out everything yourself. Many generous founders that came before you did all the hard work of distilling thousands of hours of research and years of real-work experience into concise patterns you can upload into your brain in just a few hours. 

Here are the one’s I find the most useful:

## Unfair Advantages

Unfair advantages exist. Instead of whining about how unfair the world is, you’re better off focusing on your own unfair advantages and coming up with a plan to add more to your repertoire. 

## The Startup Curve

## Sitcom Startup Ideas

“*Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming up with good startup ideas is hard. It's not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually bad. The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends, they don't say "I would never
 use this." They say "Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that." Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users.” - [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)*

## The Idea Maze

*“Good startup ideas are well developed, multi-year plans that contemplate many possible paths according to how the world changes.” - [Chris Dixon](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze)*

## Fuckarounditis

Fuckarounditis is a behavioral disorder characterized by a complete lack of real-world progress, despite significant amounts of time invested. Fuckarounditis most commonly manifests itself as an intense preoccupation with designing logos, printing business cards, and dreaming up infrastructure that scales. Fear of launching and marketing is another distinguishing trait.

Doing things that don’t scale or activities that require overcoming The Resistance are either completely lacking or misapplied

## The Resistance

The Resistance is a force in your life that is there to try to stop you from your goals.

It’s a term coined by Steven Pressfield in his book The War of Art to define the internal forces that oppose all forms of creativity. 

Everyone experiences The Resistance. But the one thing successful people understand that other’s don’t is that you can apply a simple Jiu-Jitsu trick to turn The Resistance into a positive force in your live. 

Instead of stopping whenever The Resistance shows up, you can embrace it by treating it as a compass that helps you figure out what direction you should be moving in. The most progress is usually found in directions where you experience the biggest Resistance.

## Reality has a surprising amount of details

Everyone underestimates how much complexity is hidden beneath the surface of even the most trivial things like a can opener. Everyone feels confident to draw a diagram or write out an explanation how a can opener works. But if you’re actually trying to do this and then read a [description of how a can opener actually works](https://sciencing.com/mechanism-description-of-a-manual-can-opener-12587926.html) or [look at this diagram](https://taylorpearson.me/can-opener-diagram/), you will quickly notice how naive your understanding really is. 

The same phenomenon occurs when it comes to businesses. On the surface many business models are trivially easy to understand. Hubspot makes software to send emails to your customers. But why then, did it take them hundreds of iterations until they found that specific sweetspot with product/market fit? And why does a company like Google or Twitter need thousands of employees? Hosting and maintaining website is not that hard, right?

## The Dunning-Kruger Curve

## Product Market Fit

Through of sorrow

Playbooks

meta pattern. existence of playbooks and using them increases odds. 

X for Y. But also much simpler ecommerce story, facebook ads.

Constrains breed creativity

Twitter, vine. 

But also busines. focus on specififc market and then move around 

idea maze. 

Market risk, technology risk. 

Unfair Advantages
