The main difference between experienced and less experienced founders is that they have larger repertoire of patterns to refer to. Call them frameworks, patterns, whatever. 

When the initial excitement fades, beginners start to panic but experienced founders know that this is just the usual trough of sorrow and stay focused. 

And the good news is that you don’t have to figure out everything yourself. Many generous founders that came before you did all the hard work of distilling thousands of hours of research and years of real-work experience into concise patterns you can upload into your brain in just a few hours. 

Here are the one’s I find the most useful:

## Unfair Advantages

Unfair advantages exist. Instead of whining about how unfair the world is, you’re better off focusing on your own unfair advantages and coming up with a plan to add more to your repertoire. 

## Leverage

Levers are force multipliers. They are the reason why some people can accomplish 10, 100x, or 1,000,000x what others can.

There are four forms of leverage:

- Tools: A skilled person with the right tools can build an entire house or cut down an entire forest. 
- People: You can hire or collaborate with people to 10x, 100x, or 1000x the impact you have on the world.
- Capital (money): The same investment decision with 10x the capital returns 10x the results.
- Digital Products (software, media): Created once, these assets can serve an infinite number of customers.

## The Startup Curve

![startup curve](/images/startup-curve.png)

## Sitcom Startup Ideas

“*Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming up with good startup ideas is hard. It's not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually bad. The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends, they don't say "I would never
 use this." They say "Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that." Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users.” - [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)*

## The Idea Maze

*“Good startup ideas are well developed, multi-year plans that contemplate many possible paths according to how the world changes.” - [Chris Dixon](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze)*

## Fuckarounditis

Fuckarounditis is a behavioral disorder characterized by a complete lack of real-world progress, despite significant amounts of time invested. Fuckarounditis most commonly manifests itself as an intense preoccupation with designing logos, printing business cards, and dreaming up infrastructure that scales. Fear of launching and marketing is another distinguishing trait.

Doing things that don’t scale or activities that require overcoming The Resistance are either completely lacking or misapplied

(free after [Martin Berkhan](https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/))

## The Resistance

The Resistance is a force in your life that is there to try to stop you from your goals.

It’s a term coined by Steven Pressfield in his book The War of Art to define the internal forces that oppose all forms of creativity. 

Everyone experiences The Resistance. But the one thing successful people understand that other’s don’t is that you can apply a simple Jiu-Jitsu trick to turn The Resistance into a positive force in your live. 

Instead of stopping whenever The Resistance shows up, you can embrace it by treating it as a compass that helps you figure out what direction you should be moving in. The most progress is usually found in directions where you experience the biggest Resistance.

## Reality has a surprising amount of details

Everyone underestimates how much complexity is hidden beneath the surface of even the most trivial things like a can opener. Everyone feels confident to draw a diagram or write out an explanation how a can opener works. But if you’re actually trying to do this and then read a [description of how a can opener actually works](https://sciencing.com/mechanism-description-of-a-manual-can-opener-12587926.html) or [look at this diagram](https://taylorpearson.me/can-opener-diagram/), you will quickly notice how naive your understanding really is. 

The same phenomenon occurs when it comes to businesses. On the surface many business models are trivially easy to understand. Hubspot makes software to send emails to your customers. But why then, did it take them hundreds of iterations until they found that specific sweetspot with product/market fit? And why does a company like Google or Twitter need thousands of employees? Hosting and maintaining website is not that hard, right?

## The Dunning-Kruger Curve

## Product Market Fit

## X for Y Startups

People love describing startups as “X for Y”. Facebook for X, Uber for X. Superhuman for X...

*"This is a really common format to describe startup ideas because it accomplishes a couple things all at once: First, it positions you against something successful. Second, it both conveys a lot of information and also doesn’t — when someone who hears the idea, it’s like a short puzzle to solve to try and understand what it might mean. And yet, as a one-liner, it begs for interactivity, so that people will ask more."*

## Constrains breed Creativity

Most people struggle when they're asked to write down three ideas.

But if ask you to come up with two product ideas that would help local bakerys attract more customers, I bet you could do it. 

Writing an essay is a hard for most people.

But writing 300 words about how the rise of AirBnb is very doable (with a bit of research).

So the next time you're struggling to come up with ideas, add constraints. If you're struggling to come up with answers, make the question more specific. If you're struggling to come up with solutions, consider the problem in the context of all limits you're operating within.


## Market Risk vs. Technical Risk

*“A mistake a lot of entrepreneurs make is to only focus on ideas that are definitely possible but have questionable product-market fit. These ideas have low technical risk but high product-market fit risk. I think more people should be doing the opposite: focus on ideas that are definitely valuable and questionably possible. In many ways, market risk is worse because you’re gonna do all the hard work of building the thing and no one wants it.”* - Kyle Vogt as quoted by [Shaan Puri](https://www.listennotes.com/de/podcasts/my-first-million/129-why-elon-musk-is-the-lGt2R0sOcuT/)

*"Younger founders should take market risk (market that are small or doesn't exist yet). Older founders should take execution risk (market is very clear & execution, expertise, and relationships are the differentiator)."* - [Eric Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1243820699543687170)

## Lateral Thinking

![outside the box thinking](/images/outside-the-box.png)

*"The goal of the puzzle (left) is to link all 9 dots using four straight lines or fewer, without lifting the pen and without tracing the same line more than once. All such answers (one example shown right) require the solver to draw a line that extends outside of the "box" formed by the grid."* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_outside_the_box#Nine_dots_puzzle) 

*"Pretend you are driving a car in the middle of a thunderstorm and you happen upon three people on the side of the road. One of them is a frail old woman, who looks on the verge of collapse. Another is a friend who once saved your life. The other is the romantic interest of your dreams, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet him or her. You have only one other seat in the car. Who do you pick up? There’s a good reason to choose any of the three. The old woman needs help. The friend deserves your payback. And clearly, a happy future with the man or woman of your dreams will have an enormous long-term impact on your life. So, who should you pick? The old woman, of course. Then, give the car keys to your friend, and stay behind with the romantic interest to wait for the bus!"* - from Smartcuts by Shane Snow

## Quantity Leads to Quality

*"A ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay."*

## Originality through Imitation.

Copying texts by great author by hand is an effective way to improve the quality of your writing. Hunter S. Thompson, for example, once hand-wrote every word of the Great Gatsby. Ben Franklin spent years copying newspaper articles.

You don't learn a new musical instrument by writing your own songs. You learn other people's songs. Then, after mastering and finding what you like, you develop your own voice using the patterns you noticed in copying others.

And many startups start as rather weak of imitations of existing businesses and then slowly iterate their way towards a unique value proposition.

## The ORB Framework

![orb framework](/images/orb-framework.png)

*"Marketing strategies and tactics can be broken down into three main categories: Owned, Rented, and Borrowed. In other words, you have lines of communications to an audience that you either own, rent, or borrow."*

## There are no bad ideas, only early ideas

*“There are no bad ideas. There are only early ideas… They’ll all happen. I’ve become convinced...Every smart person that comes in here with a crazy idea, it’s all going to happen at some point. They will all happen. It’s just a question of when.”*- Andreessen

There was a board game that was Monopoly for failed 90s ideas. The "stupid" failed ideas were: social networking & games, reviews & group discount buying. Good ideas pan out eventually.

## Shape Yourself Like A "T"

![t framework](/images/expert-t.png)

*"Go broad by knowing the basics including pros/cons of most channels.  Then choose to go really deep on a couple channels.  Generalists are useless in most work environments.  As an expert in certain areas you will be able to build a brand around yourself and stand out from the crowd."* -  [Brian Balfour](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/customer-acquisition)

## The founder is the surfer

* the founder is the surfer
*  the product is the surfboard
* the market is the wave

The wave matters most. A good surfer on a bad wave is screwed.

## Functioning complex are not designed but emerge

*"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system."* - John Gall in his book Systemantics

## Working Backwards

Working Backwards is an approach popularized by Amazon. Employees start projects by writing the press release and FAQs.

The same approach can be applied in many variations for all kinds of projects. 

For example, witers can work backwards too. Write the tweet people will use to share your article before you write the article itself.

## Avoid the Middle

In many areas it's a lot smarter to focus on the extremes than trying a more balanced approach. 

![barbell strategy](/images/barbell.png)

For example, learn from cheap books and free articles or high-end premium courses that offer 1-1 support and live QnA sessions. Anything in-between is a waste of money.

When comes to businesses, do tiny experiments or go all in. Anything in-between is a waste of time.
