title: How to create a humble personal brand
permalink: /personal-brand

As usual, let's start with why.

Now that [code and design are no longer bottlenecks](/bottlenecks), marketing has become even more important. Unfortunately, it not only has become more important but also more difficult as more and more  companies are competing for the attention of customers.

While there are several strategies that humble entrepreneurs can use to generate traffic to their product pages, the most sustainable and effective strategy remains to create a personal brand. This is true because humble entrepreneurs simply can't compete with the marketing budgets of big companies. Hence, they have to focus on the one advantage they have: authenticity. 

Importantly this means that building a humble personal brand is not about becoming an influencer. Humble personal brands and influencers live on opposite ends of the personal branding spectrum. Being an influencer is all about selling a dream and it doesn't matter if it's fake, as long as it entertains and inspires people. Building a humble personal brand is all about being authentic. After all, being you is the one thing no one, irregardless of how big their marketing budget is, can compete with you on.

A key aspect of the [humble business strategy](/humble-strategy) is to place lots of small bets until you find something that works. The most difficult aspect of this strategy is that you have to find an audience for each new product launch. And this is exactly what a personal brand can help you with. Once you've built a personal brand, you don't have to start from scratch each time. You can simply ask your "fans" what they think. Usually, this is all you need to make your product stand out and attract customers. Your "fans" will give your product the first few upvotes that are so important to avoid that it gets lost in the noise. Moreover, some of your followers will become your first customers and help you to validate more quickly if your idea has any chance at sustainable success. 

It's for this reason, that building a personal brand is the single best investment you'll ever make as a humble entrepreneur. 

But there are, of course, also other advantages. For example, a personal brand makes it much easier to build powerful connections. This will allow you to put all these sleazy old-school networking efforts behind you since interesting people will start to reach out to you. Once your personal brand has crossed a certain threshold you'll become a lighthouse for like-minded people.

## The two types of fame

Most humble entrepreneurs feel uncomfortable admitting that they want to become famous. This is a mistake since, as argued above, a personal brand is an invaluable asset and without it humble entrepreneurship is rarely sustainable. 

The problem people have with the word fame is that they associate it with people like Kim Kardashian. This is certainly not what we want. Humble entrepreneurs don't dream of appearing on the cover of Forbes magazine. We leave that dream for the startup crowd.

Hence, the key to overcome the limiting attitude that fame is bad, is to realize that there's also a different kind of fame. Let's call it Charlie Munger fame. 

- Kim Kardashian Fame means you're famous for being famous and that almost everybody recognizes you.
- Charlie Munger Fame means that there's a small number of people who deeply respect what you do and how you think. You're famous for a few and you rarely get asked on the street for a selfie.

People who have Charlie Munger Fame get interviewed on podcasts, people read their books and attend their events. But the main difference is that they're famous for just a small number of people - thousands instead of millions.

> - Tynan,
> - Nat Eliason,
> - Glen Allsopp,
> - Pieter Levels,
> - Jason Fried,

The good news is that Charlie Munger fame is all it takes nowadays. You just need to be famous for a thousand people to make a living. Famous in this context means that there are people who never met you but who still trust and like you and feel like they know you.  It means that there is a core group of people who really care about what you're up to.

[Thousand true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) has kind of become the magical number analogous to the 10,000 hour rule for learning. However, the exact number you need to sustain your independence depends heavily on what exactly you do and sell. For example, it's also possible to argue that [100 true fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/) is all that you need. 

What, however, seems clear that if there are between 1000 and 10,000 people for whom you're famous, you've succeeded in building a sustainable personal brand. At this point, your brand typically keeps growing without much effort from your side. You'll get podcast interview invitations regularly and be asked to comment on recent trends and developments.

Now that we've talked about the "why" and the "what", it's time to talk about *how* exactly you can build a successful humble personal brand.

## Cornerstones of a successful humble personal brand

- You need to publish **content**. Without essays, books, videos, or podcasts it's almost impossible to build a personal brand. People need to be able to immerse themselves in your thoughts and grasp the way you think before they become loyal followers. Moreover, each piece of content is like a lighthouse for like-minded people and hence has the potential to make new people aware of your work.
    - You should focus on publishing:
        - **Permanent Assets**. Typically essays full of valuable ideas that will stay relevant for years to come and hence compound in value. Permanent assets are essential to turn people who discover your work into loyal fans.
        - **Postcards**.  Typically tweets or newsletter with short, thoughtful, and personal updates from a moment in time that allow you to maintain a connection with your audience and grow it. Take note that this distinction is not about length. Permanent assets can sometimes be just a hundred words and hence shorter than, say, a newsletter. But while a newsletter is rarely revisited months after it was published, an insightful essay will attract visitors for years to come who get value out of it.  A common mistake by creators who want to build a personal brand is that they spend too much time on content that lives in-between these two extremes. For example, essays that won't stand the test of time will forever keep you in a treadmill of never-ending production and often serve no clear purpose.

- You need to have a **clear philosophy**. To give people a chance to grasp the way you think you need to state what you do and how you think repeatedly in clear terms.  The more you talk about your beliefs in an accessible way, the more people become your loyal fans. [No one can compete with you on being you](https://twitter.com/naval/status/797865441783709696). Since you want to build a personal brand, people need to be able to see your personality shine through. This means that you need to give up the idea of being loved by everybody.  Your philosophy is made up of your strongly held beliefs and opinions. It's your take on life and it doesn't need to appeal to everyone. If you polish everything so that no one can criticize it, it'll all be so bland that you won't attract any true fans. Focus ruthlessly on the people who like the way you think. Develop a clear philosophy, put it out to the world and observe who shows up as a result. Ask yourself:

    - What's your philosophy?
    - What is something you believe that rarely anyone agrees with you on?
    - What do you believe about your field that most people are not aware of?
    - What do you stand for? What do you stand against?
    - What is the change you want to see in the world?

    But please, don't try to be controversial for the sake of it. Be nice but stay authentic. 

- You need to **publish content consistently**. People don't become loyal fans after seeing your work once. Instead, they need to stumble repeatedly upon your work. Often around ten or more "points of contact" are needed. Importantly, this means that you can't just write one essay titled "My Philosophy" and call it a day. Instead, your philosophy needs to become part of everything you publish. Revisit the same questions again and again. People often need to hear something more than five times before they "get it". Hence you need to show up regularly and describe repeatedly what you do and how you think. Two great strategies to accomplish this are:

    - Work with the garage door up. Don't just publish announcements of finished work. Allow people to see how you work and what you're working on.  Give a lecture about the problems you’re pondering in the shower; think loud about the ways in which your project doesn’t work at all. People want to see the process with all its messy details and ups and downs. This is the best way to share your philosophy in an authentic way.
    - Be helpful. Repeatedly ask yourself: What is something I wished someone had told me earlier? Then talk about these things.

That's really it. Just focus on these three points and you'll be surprised how quickly your humble personal brand grows. In a series of follow-up articles I will discuss in more detail:

- How exactly you can create permanent assets that compound in value and represent the cornerstones of your personal brand.
- How to use "postcards" effectively to grow your audience.
- Ethical hacks to accelerate your personal brands growth.

If you want to dive even deeper and learn more about personal branding, I highly recommend the following books:

- Expert Secrets by Russell Brunson,
- Oversubscribed by Daniel Priestley,
- Show your Work  by Austin Kleon.

But to avoid falling into the analysis paralysis trap, just start right now. After reading this article, you already know enough to get started. Once you've started you can still refine your strategy along the way.  Remember: “The best time to build a personal brand was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”
