A lot of agency owners really just created a well-paid job for themselves, not a business.

One reason is that there is really only a lot of advice on how to get started. Tons of books and courses will teach you how to get from zero to, say, $30k/month. 

But at this point, your business is most likely 100% dependent on you and stuff starts breaking left and right. You've reached the limit of what you stay on top of.

So many agencies stay at this plateau forever. They are stuck at around $30k/month and can't grow beyond that. Revenue will go up a bit, clients become unhappy since service delivery suffers, and then revenue goes down again. Rinse and repeat.

What you need to do to break through this plateau is to turn your agency from basically a well-paid job into a proper business.

This requires proper systems and processes that allow you to remove yourself from the day-to-day operations. As long as you're part of the equation, you're the bottleneck and won't be able to grow beyond a certain point.

Now there are a few books that talk about this that get recommended a lot. The E-Myth Revisited is one of them. From Six to Seven Figures by Austin Netzley, Built to Sell, Clockwork by Mike Michalowicz, and Traction by Gino Wickman are some others.

At the core they all say the exact same things. But while they use a lot of words, they do not contain many details that are immediately actionable for your specific business. This is inevitable since popular books must appeal to a wide range of businesses.

So I figured I would save you some time by sharing my condensed version of the advice from these books.

In a nutshell, you need to build four core machines:

* The Fullfillment Machine
* The Sales Machine
* The Hiring Machine
* The Team Machine

Yes, there is a fifth one. I'm not that bad at math. We will talk about that final machine later.

Now let's go through the four machines listed one by one.

## The Fullfillment Machine

It really all starts with fullfillment. You need systems and process someone else can follow to deliver the service you're selling.

In practice this means you need to write SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for every step required to deliver the value you're selling.

Depending on the [agency game](/agency-games) you're playing, this can be a lot or relatively little work. If your plan is work with an army of cheap VAs, your SOPs need to be crazy detailed. Every single step has to be documented with zero room for interpretation.

If you're going down the boutique agency route, you can get away with a lot less since you're working with A-players who can figure out a lot of stuff on their own.

In addition to your SOPs you need systems. Typically this means checklists and a few automations in the task management tool of your choice. When a new client signs up, create these 7 tasks (each one with a SOP attached), assign them to these people, that kind of stuff.

## The Sales Machine


## How to build the Machines

No one has ever built all four machines in week or so. The key is making steady progress. 

First you need to make sure that a machine exists at all. Without SOPs and systems, no machine exists. Pretty simple.

The next stage is that your machine can run 7 days without you. If you can take a week off and your machine keeps running, you're in a good spot.

The final stage is when your machine can not only run indefinitely without you, but also improve itself. 

The reason why this is really one stage and not two is that there is no stagnation. You're either improving or you're getting worse. There is no middle ground. So unless your machine is improving itself, it's getting worse. And this in turn means it can't run indefinitely without you.

So it's really useful to create a little matrix to track your machine building progress every month. It's really motivating to see the machine building progress in a visual way.

On top you write the names of the four machines: Fullfillment, Sales, Hiring, Team. On the left side you write the three stages: Exists, Runs 7 days without me, Improves itself.

Then you fill in the boxes with the current status of each machine and update it every month.

## Monitoring your machines

There is a final machine you need to build: The Machine Machine. It's the machine that keeps all the other machines running. 

This machine, in a sense, is really your agency itself.

What you need to be able to tell confidently if any of your machines functions properly or can even run and improve without you, is data. 

You need metrics that tell you how well your machines are running.

People usually call them KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
