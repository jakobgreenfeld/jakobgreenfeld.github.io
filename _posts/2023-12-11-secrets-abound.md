"the idea we live in the developed world is a travesty"

"In many of our largest industries, our models of how the world works are worse than broken. "

"You can look at almost any undesirable outcome in the world - humans getting chronically sick at record levels, pollution, infertility, trauma, rising rates of depression - and assume that our most popular models of the world are broken, that there are secrets to discover. "

"This is depressing in one sense, and exciting in another. As an entrepreneur, if you can figure out a true, accurate model of the world in any number of fields, there is money to be made and companies to be built. "

Education -> learn in a few days more than in a year schools? alpha school! https://twitter.com/AlphaSchoolATX
"I met a billionaire recently whose thing is starting schools that guarantee top decile performance with only 2 hours of academics per day. And it’s working." https://twitter.com/amelapay/status/1732139402233569330


Health -> 

Mental Health -> "Take depression. Dr. Chris Palmer has written often about the relationship between depression and mental health. Much talk therapy is relatively ineffective: could you build a more effective therapy intervention that focuses foremost on physical health? I suspect so."

Science -> 


"There are specific ideas (like metabolic psychiatry) that may be secrets. Then there are entire philosophies that - if true - would generate hundreds of ideas and opportunities. Today, our culture mainly understands things through the scientific method, through experimentation. If it turns out that (as Seeing Like a State would argue) wisdom in traditions, in religions, are better ways to understand what’s happening in the world, well there are secrets to uncover. "
