*Here's a collection of questions and observations that you can use to assess the potential of your ideas.*

**1 Observation by [Patrick McKenzie](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/validating_product_ideas)**

- Many things which purport to make particular business processes easier are not in fact solving a problem, because the existing process is Good Enough. If you can't find any book written about it, any competing software, any much-maligned downloadable Excel spreadsheets... consider that it might not be an important enough problem.

**1 Observation by [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1243820699543687170)**

- Younger founders should take market risk (market that are small or doesn't exist yet)

Older founders should take execution risk (market is very clear & execution, expertise, and relationships are the differentiator).

**2 Questions by [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)**

- Who wants this right now?
- Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of?

**3 Questions by [Andreessen Horowitz](https://justinjackson.ca/today)**

- Who really wants this today?
- How many of those people are out in the wild?
- What macro story must play out in the market [for there to be] market-wide demand?

**5 Questions by [Tyler Tringas](https://tylertringas.com/business-ideas-meat-grinder/)**

- Can I make this?
- Are people currently spending money on it?
- How will I get the first 25 customers? Then the next 250?
- If it works, will it be sustainable?
- Am I the person to build this business?

**5 Commandments by MJ DeMarco**

- Commandment of Control. Is there one person or entity that can instantly kill your business with one decision? Are you fishing in a pond controlled by someone else? And what happens to your business when that pond is taken away?
- Commandment of Entry. If you do something that takes minutes to accomplish or solve, was there really a problem? Or are you merely stacking yourself atop a mountain of already existing solutions? If you’re starting a Mexican restaurant in a city full of Mexican restaurants, you aren’t satisfying dire cravings.
- The Commandment of Need. Do you provide sufficient relative value? If you open a pizza bistro and there’s already twenty-five other pizza places nearby, have you provided relative value? Your pizza might be darn good, but relative value doesn’t exist because more than likely, a few other pizza joints are also darn good.
- The Commandment of Time. Is there a way for you to detach income and your time?
- The Commandment of Scale. Is what you're selling replicable, or easily copied into multiple units, locations or chains?
