One of the most common mistakes made by aspiring entrepreneurs is that they stick for far too long to an idea they feel is just too perfect to give up. Yes, there is a time and place for definite optimism. But it's not a good strategy if you're just starting out. Save your big dreams for a time when your independence is sustainable.

A much safer strategy that rarely ever fails completely - let's call it the humble business strategy - is to start with a series of really simple products. 

The key advantages of this strategy are:

- You'll learn faster the rules of the entrepreneurial game and the skills that you really need (ideation and marketing). Since [ideas and marketing are the remaining bottlenecks](/bottlenecks), it doesn't make sense to waste months building complicated products. By focusing on simple product ideas that you can [validate quickly](/validation), you can learn a lot more effectively what kind of ideas and which marketing efforts really do work. You'll be able to develop a taste for what works and what doesn't which is impossible if you've just one data point. It's [quantity which eventually will lead to quality](https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/). 
- You'll stay motivated since you get feedback and your first paying customers early. It's extremely unlikely that all of your ideas will fail completely. While you won't get rich with your first few products either, you typically will find at least a few paying customers. This is all you need to confirm that you're on the right track and give you the motivation that you need to continue your journey.
- It's much easier to get noticed if you regularly launch new products. Each product launch gives you plenty of topics to talk about and represents a chance for people to discover your work. In contrast, startup founders typically remain in stealth mode for months if not years which is wasted time from a marketing perspective.
- It'll allow you to develop a bias for action which is arguably the most important trait if you want to succeed as an entrepreneur.

> “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.” ― Ira Glass

Let's talk about the strategy in a bit more detail.

## The humble business strategy

The ideal mindset is to think like a book publisher. A publisher knows that most of the books won't sell more than a few copies. But this is perfectly fine since he doesn't put all of his eggs into one basket. 

It's simply impossible to predict which book will be a huge success. Hence publishers publish a lot of books and then let the market decide. Importantly, they don't print millions of copies of each book. They always start with a small batch and only once the market demands it, they'll print more. This way, the potential downside is limited while the upside is unrestricted. 

This is exactly what you should do with your products. Create a portfolio of small bets. Don't invest too much into a single product. Even the best ideas can fail for reasons that are outside of your control. And only once the market demands it, you should make your product ready for a much larger customer base. It's perfectly fine to start with something that doesn't scale. 

A key aspect of this strategy is that you need to stop looking for perfect opportunities. No one can predict which ideas will turn out to be successful. Even the most successful publishers, after decades of experience, publish hundreds of books each year that only sell a handful of copies. 

This doesn't mean that all ideas are equally good. You should, of course, focus on the [best ideas that you can find](/ideation). And as you keep launching, you'll develop a much better understanding of what characterizes a good idea. The key is to focus on ideas where you can reasonably expect that they won't fail completely. Go for the low hanging fruit first. Then gradually start looking for bigger opportunities. 

Talk publicly about your successes and failures and share your learnings. This will allow your to build a [personal brand](/personal-brand) which will simplify your marketing efforts tremendously.

Keep launching simple products until one of them turns out to be a "blockbuster". Then put all of your attention on it and find out how big it can get. Once growth starts to stagnate, it often makes sense to put it on autopilot (as much as this is possible) and start to launch new products again.
