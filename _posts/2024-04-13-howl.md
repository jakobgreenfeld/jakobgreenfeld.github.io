One of the best characters in the TV Show Californication is an author called Richard Bates.

He's a complete lunatic. But what makes him so entertaining is that he accepts all offers.

When someone comes to him and asks "Can you help us smuggle some drugs into the rehab center?" his answer is "Sounds like an adventure, let's go!".

Later at the rehab center, when everyone starts acting crazy after taking drugs he comments "Howl with the wolves!" before joining in.

Offer-block-accept dynamic is something I'm learning a lot about from improv.

Bad improvisers block all the time and make dull offers, if any.

Watching someone block offers is boring and disappointing. Playing with someone who blocks your offers is incredibly frustrating.

Imagine Richard Bates responding to the initial offer with "Nah, I'm busy." or to the later one "Look at these weirdos.".

Vibe killers is good name for people like this.

Blocking makes you feel higher status. This is why it's the default mode for most people. 

It's also a lot safer. Most people block until they have certainty about what's going to happen.

But blocking makes you a boring person to be around and sucks the energy out of your interactions with others.

Great improvisers on the other hand accept all offers and make ![interesting offers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ) all the time themselves.

Watching someone accept all offers is incredibly fun. Playing with someone like this is amazing.

And once you've been sensitized to offer-block-accept dynamic, you start seeing it everywhere in real life, not just on stage or in TV shows.

Life is a lot more fun once you start accepting more offers and start making more interesting offers yourself.

As Keith Johnstone notes in Impro:

*"People with dull lives often think that their lives are dull by chance. In reality everyone chooses more or less what kind of events will happen to them by their conscious patterns of blocking and yielding."*
