Why did you open this essay? Do you even have a reason? Did you even think about it? I bet the answer is no. And that, my friend, is a problem.

Don't get me wrong, I personally think itâ€™s awesome youâ€™re here. Someone is actually taking minutes of their precious time to read something I've writing. That's amazing. Thanks!

But Iâ€™m just a random guy on the internet and thereâ€™s no reason why you should care about my feelings. Iâ€™m neither particularly smart nor entertaining. So why are you here if you could instead create something or at least learn from someone worth learning from?

I know itâ€™s uncomfortable but let's pause for a moment and think about it. How and why did you end up here? 

Questions like this are magical because they force you to break your personal frame for a moment. 

Usually I'm shocked what I see during these elusive moments of clarity where I'm observing myself objectively.

There are so many things I deeply care about, so many goals I want to achieve in my limited time on planet earth. And here I am wasting another hour reading some random guy's braindump. It's heart breaking. 

Yes I'm writing this as a reminder for myself. Instead of finishing this essay, I just checked Twitter and Reddit. See I'm definetly not who you should learn from. 

Now close this tab and do something that actually matters.
