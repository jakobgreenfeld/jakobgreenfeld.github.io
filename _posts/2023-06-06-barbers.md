>"My business coach charges $5,000/hour. And to tell you the truth... it's a great deal. Good coaching literally makes you money." - some guy called [Rich](https://twitter.com/richwebz/status/1663954750188945440) on Twitter.

Whenever I see someone posting something like Rich here, I check if they sell coaching themselves... and they always do.

Of course Rich is a business coach himself.

You see this on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Reddit, blogs. Everywhere.

And it's always the same thing.

The real estate guy screams: "hiring VA's is lifechanging! You only pay them $5/hour and they are like 100x more productive than your lazy American workers!"

Now what [Mr. Real Estate](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1509357378042535936) forgets to mention is that owns a significant percentage of the company he [recommends](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1509358126394396676) to source Phillipino workers.

When someone pulls up that Warren Buffet quote "Investing in yourself is the best thing you can do", you just know they are about to sell you a course.

The guy preaching the life-changing magic of writing online is of course selling a $3k cohort-based course on writing online.

Now of course there are still people giving genuine advice out there. But it's becoming so damn hard to find them.

People who treat content as the top of their funnel tend to be 10x louder than those sharing genuine advice just for the sake of it.

They will happily pay for retweets, likes, and fake engagement. They will make sure their message is reposted every few months to maximize reach. They have absolutely no problem repeating the same talking points [over and over again](https://twitter.com/search?q=5%20philipines%20(from%3Asweatystartup)&src=typed_query&f=top) because they are making money every single time they do it.

Now unfortunately I don't have a good solution. It seems inevitable.

The best I can do is to raise awareness. So please keep in mind, most of the "advice" out there is no different than a barber telling you you need a haircut.

The more people understand this, the less effective this strategy will become.

So, tell your friends, tell your mom. 

And most importantly, tell everywone whenever you someone trying to pull this off.
