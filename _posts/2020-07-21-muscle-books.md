There are far more books on bodybuilding and weightlifting than anyone
could ever read. However, most of them primarily promote the author's
favorite workout routines and theories based on personal anecdotes. There are just a few noteworthy exceptions that give advice based on scientific evidence.

So, here are a few recommendations if you want to dig deeper into the
literature.

Great general books that are written in the same spirit as my article series are:

-   *The Muscle and Strength Pyramid: Training* and *The Muscle and
    Strength Pyramid: Nutrition* by Helms, Valdez, and Morgan.

-   *The Art of Lifting* and *The Science of Lifting* by Nuckols and
    Isuf.

-   *Scientific Principles of Strength Training* by Israetel, Hoffmann,
    and Smith.

Excellent textbooks that go far deeper and discuss, for example, the
underlying biochemical processes are:

-   *Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy* by Schoenfeld

-   *The Science and Practice of Strength Training* by Zatsiorsky and
    Kraemer

A great book if you want to understand which muscles exactly get
targeted by a specific exercise is (which is especially important for [program building considerations](/program-building))

-   *Strength Training Anatomy* by Frederic Delavier


The science of weightlifting and hypertrophy are still their infancy and
new data is coming out almost every month. While books are great for
many things they are certainly too slow keep up with every new
development. Thus here are several non-book sources you can consult if
you want to stay up to date:

-   *Stronger by Science* is the blog of Greg Nuckols who reviews many
    of the most interesting recent studies. In addition, he host a
    podcast and publishes an excellent monthly research review in
    collaboration with Eric Helms and Mike Zourdos titled MASS.

-   *The Revive Stronger Podcast* hosts many discussions and interviews
    with world-leading experts on all kinds of topics related to
    weightlifting, powerlifting and bodybuilding.

-   *The Sustainable Self-Development Podcast* hosted by Abel Csabai is
    another great podcast which regular features expert interviews and
    discussions.

-   *Jeff Nippard's* Youtube channel is an entertaining source of
    evidence based fitness news.
