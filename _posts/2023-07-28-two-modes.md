I've noticed that I have two modes of operating.

Mode A is a state of effortless intensity. Guns blazing. 

I'm racing through my todo list. No time is wasted. 

Twitter does not even exists as far as I'm concerned.

No invisible walls. I'm moving much too fast to even notice them.

There is no "next week" or "maybe". That shit is getting done NOW.

I'm expanding in all directions.

Everything simply gets done.

At the end of the day, my tank is still full. I'm ready to socialize, go to the gym, cook a nice meal.

Mode B is a state of doubt and hesitation. 

I'm second guessing everything. 

I can't even decide what task to work on next. Is this really the best use of my time right now?

I'm constantly tempted to check Twitter.

Every idea is immediately crushed by a million reasons why it won't work.

I feel stuck. 

Nothing really moves forward.

At the end of the day, I'm completely drained. I just want to lay on the couch, order some takeout, and watch Netflix.

Obviously, I want to spend as much time as possible in Mode A.

Most successful people spend most of their time in Mode A.

Infectious. 

Also organizations.
