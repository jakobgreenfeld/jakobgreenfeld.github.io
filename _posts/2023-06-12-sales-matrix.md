There is a point in your career where you realize that nearly everything is sales.

Sales activities can be split across two axis: internal vs. external and prospects vs. employees.

* Sell to customers externally: this is the obvious one. You need to sell to prospects to get new customers.
* Sell to customers internally: you need to retain customers by repeatedly selling them on your product or service.
* Sell to employees internally: you need to sell your vision to your team. You need to keep your team happy.
* Sell to employees externally: you need to sell your company to potential employees. You need to attract the best talent.
