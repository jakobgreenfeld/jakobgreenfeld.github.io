* Ego is addicted to being right even if it means continuing living in suffering.
* Performance suffers when we become frustrated or afraid of perceived pressure and fear of failure. An effective way to deal with this is to embrace the worst case scenario. Imagine the worst case scenario had already happened? Could you be okay with that?
* Most people are exhausted trying to get rid of all possible frustrations by perfecting their cicrumstances. This is a futile endeavor. Instead, you can choose to play a different game. Reframe: "Life will present you with people and circumstances to reveal where you’re not free." The game then becomes: Who can get rid of their fears the quickest?
