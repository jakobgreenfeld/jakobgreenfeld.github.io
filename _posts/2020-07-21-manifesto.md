The goal, trite as it sounds, is to create, to make things. Not the next Google or Facebook, certainly, but something all our own. We want to ignore the noise and focus on creation over consumption. 

We want to add something to the world. Our creations are an outlet for our creativity. They are opinionated and a form of self-expression. While we don't expect to change the world, we want to create things that others enjoy and find useful. 

And yes, we want to make money this way. It's not a hobby. We're serious, full-time creators and need to be paid accordingly. But our goal is not to amass billions. We're satisfied with just enough to live an independent, happy life.

Our goal is to create sustainable businesses. We don't want to waste our time with get-rich quick-schemes.

We're aware that to thrive, we must first survive.  Hence, our strategy is to create a portfolio of small bets until they pay enough to sustain our lifestyle.  We don't become too fixated on a single idea since we're aware that even the best idea can fail for reasons outside of our control. We take more aggressive risks only once our independence is sustainable. 

We start small and validate quickly. We show up every day, refine our craft, constantly push our comfort zone, and embrace feedback as a gift. We're impatient with actions but patient with results.  

And maybe most importantly, we want to be helpful not merely appear helpful. When we give advice, we're honest and don't try to appear smarter than we are. 

There's never been a better time to be a humble creator.
