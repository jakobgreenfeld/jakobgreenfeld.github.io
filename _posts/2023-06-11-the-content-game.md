Many people completely misunderstand how the [content game](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1667710793163448321) works nowadays.

A few years ago you could focus on writing maximally useful articles. Content marketing brought in new customers.

But nowadays it's a lot more competitive. So you have to do whatever you can to get attention.

Outrage bait, lifestyle flexes, shitposts, ...

Then you convert some of the attention into followers. Followers will see some of your useful content and become subscribers. 

And over time you build enough trust through your newsletter + podcast content so that some of your subscribers will eventually become customers.

I wish this wasn't the case but I hardly see anyone succeeding just from useful content alone. 

So if you're not willing to play this kind of content game, it's probably better to focus on other channels right away.
