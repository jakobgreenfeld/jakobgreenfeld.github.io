## Meta

* Growth lies in the direction of what you're most afraid of.
* The more labels you have for yourself, the more limited you become in the quantity and quality of opportunities you see. E.g. tons of aspiring founders are stuck inside boxes like SaaS, solopreneurship, or indie hacking. They ignore anything that’s not a software idea or that would require a team or funding. Most would be 10x farther ahead if they ignored these self-imposed constraints.
* Talent and intelligence do exist but are largely overrated.
* Every disadvantage is an advantage in disguise. E.g. I'm not a native English speaker which makes it easy for me to write in a simple way. And simple writing is great writing. 
* You don't have to ask people for their permission to have them as your mentor. 
* Excessive note-taking is procrastination.
* [There is no speed limit](https://sive.rs/kimo).
* There is nothing more paralizing that unlimited options. Constraints liberate.
* The answer is never more information, a better strategy, a new tool, or some secret hack. It's always doing simple things with higher intensity for longer periods of time.
* All advice is is true - under certain conditions. But hardly anyone spells out those conditions.
* Whenever you see someone posting about the "lifechanging magic of X", check if they are selling X or benefit from you buying X. Usually they do and you should ignore their advice.
* If you want to learn how to do X, start doing X. Don't waste time with courses or books.
* Your ego's top priority is being right even if it means continuing living in suffering.
* Luck can only find you if you put yourself out there.
* Nothing happens unless *you* make shit happen.
* If you’re not failing you’re not operating at the edge. If you’re not operating at the edge, you’re not learning and progressing as much as you can. 
* Regardless of what exactly your goal is, you're around [100 failed experiments away from reaching it](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/hunting-failure). And it's entirely up to you how fast you go through them.
* Every day you either stack tiny wins or tiny losses. Each decision on its own seems pretty inconsequential. But taken together over longer periods of time, they [make all the difference](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement).
* Whenever you feel stuck, change into an environment with more spatial, social, and temporal degrees of freedom. Nature, open sky, zero deadlines, no other human nearby.

* Develop a natural distate for any form of [Fuckarounditis](https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/). 
* Learn about mimetic chains and how to break through them.
* There is absolutely no need for you to stay on top of things. Instead, try to get to the bottom of things. 
* Most experts have long forgotten what it's like to be a beginner. They suffer from the curse of knowledge. So it's much smarter to learn from someone just one step ahead of you instead.
* Practice radical simplicity whenever, wherever you can.
* Learn to recognize and avoid [insight porn](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/insight-porn).
* The key to self‐confidence is keeping the promises you make to yourself.
* Your ability to keep doing interesting things is your willingness to be embarrassed.

## Social

* People like people who like them. So to become more likeable, start liking people.
* Let people tell you no. Don’t make the decision for them. Especially when you’re scared of asking for help, ask for help.
* The strongest frame you can adopt is one where you treat everything as a compliment and an everyone as a friend.
* Jealousy is the best compass for your own insecurities.Use it as a compass to find out what you need to work on.
* Forge connections. Don't just coexist in the same room.
* The more you try to control your social image, the less likeable you are. 
* Follow up, follow up, follow through.
* The most connected people get rejected the most.
* At social events, play the game of trying to find the smartest person in the room.
* Send cold emails - costs nothing except for a little bit of your time but has an unlimited upside.
* Everybody wants to be invited to stuff, yet nobody wants to be the one to put themselves on the line to host even simple events.
* The most effective way to connect with others is through enthusiasm.
* The opposite of a good ideas is surprisingly often another good idea.

## Wealth

* The world wants to work with professionals not amateurs. Only once you start taking yourself seriously, others will too.
* When you start, craft a [narrative air cover](https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/03/indie-consulting-map/): some kind of project that you can lean on while your figure things out. It should give you an interesting story when you meet people and a reason to reach out to people.
* Just keep shipping until something takes off.
* You can beat a dead horse as long as you want, but it won’t come back alive. If you don't feel a pull from the market, move on.
* The world is a suprisingly efficient place. You are  usually rewarded directly in proportion to the value you create for others. And the value you provide is usually directly proportional to effort you put in plus the risk you are willing to take.
* Never take the foot off the gas. Momentum is incredibly hard to win back.

## Health

* To get in shape, life progressively heavier weights at least twice a week. Focus on the big compound lifts: squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and chin-ups. Anything else should be treated like the cherry on top and is non-essential.
* To make your workouts fun, use a reverse pyramid scheme: start with your heaviest set and then work your way down. This way you can always go for a new PR and you don't have to worry about saving energy for the next set.
* Make sure to hit your endurance threshold at least twice a week. The best way to do this is by finding a sport you enjoy where you can go all out. Football, boxing, etc.
* Avoid packaged food as much as possible. If it has a label, it's not good for you.
* Most supplements are a just ingredients for expensive pee. Few that are not: creatine, vitamin D, and fish oil, magnesium. Be very careful to check the ingredients when buying supplements. Most are filled with crap.
* Spend time outside without glasses for at least 20 minutes every day.
