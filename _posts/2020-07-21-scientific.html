title: Taking a Scientific Approach to Muscle Training
permalink: scientific
---

<p>There is probably no topic where it is so common that people overcomplicate things to profit like bodybuilding.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magazines want to convince you that you need to try this brand new exercise if you want to maximize your gains,</p></li>
<li><p>Youtube and Instagram influencers regularly come up with new premium workout plans that, they promise, will finally help you look like them, and</p></li>
<li><p>professional bodybuilders repeat over and over again that you absolute need this special Supplement™ if you want to have a realistic chance to reach your goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The fitness industry is full of charlatans and overcomplicators.</p>
<p>Even most well-meaning advice is highly misleading. If someone lifts weights for years, it’s quite likely that he’ll make some gains. But this doesn’t mean that his approach is optimal. Taking <span class="math inline">4</span> years to get where you should have been in <span class="math inline">1</span> year is not a good place to be sharing advice from. Similarly, someone who takes steroids can do almost anything wrong and will still make greater gains than all natural lifters. And even if a steroid user trains optimally, they usually don’t realize that their recommendations are only maximally effective for other steroid users.</p>
<p>Recommendations based on personal experiences and anecdotal evidence should always be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>A much smarter approach is to have a look at the actual scientific evidence. While this approach isn’t perfect it’s certainly better than the alternative of just making stuff up. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The main reason why a scientific approach to weightlifting isn’t more widely adopted is that usually the only people who talk about scientific evidence are experts. While this may sound like a good thing it usually isn’t. Experts often have a hard time seeing the forest for the trees and suffer from the curse of knowledge. They usually can’t remember what it’s like to be a beginner and endlessly discuss nuances that aren’t really relevant for beginners.</p>
<p>So here’s some good news. This book was not written by a professional bodybuilder, influencer or leading expert. I’m an average guy and I don’t make my living in the fitness industry.</p>
<p>This is a huge advantage for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There’s no reason why I should overcomplicate things and purposefully confuse you to make you dependent. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This book will teach you everything I know since I have nothing else to sell. There’s no premium video course, private coaching, or other upsells.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not sponsored by any company in the fitness industry and thus I’ve no reason to promote useless supplements or equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Since I don’t have any expert status that I could lose, I can afford to be non-dogmatic, to discuss topics in simple and understandable terms, and to sometimes say "I don’t know". In contrast, experts (and academics in particular) usually write terribly because they write for an audience out to destroy them. They are terrified to make a mistake. And texts that are <span class="math inline">100%</span> bulletproof are in most cases unreadable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, I should clarify a few points.</p>
<p>First of all, I’m not claiming any originality. Everything discussed in the following chapters is well known to experts in the field. Instead, my value proposition is distillation, organization and synthesis.</p>
<p>Secondly, even though the recommendations in this book largely follow the general consensus in the scientific community, you shouldn’t trust them blindly. It’s always a smart idea to be skeptical of arguments from authority. Thus whenever a claim is made in the following chapters, I’ve always included direct references to the relevant studies so that you can check the data yourself. Moreover, to help you with this I’ve included a chapter on common fallacies that are often made by people who try to evaluate scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Thirdly and most importantly, this book is certainty not a good fit for everyone. It focuses solely on the fundamentals of weightlifting that are important if your primary goal is to build bigger muscles and if you are currently a novice or at an intermediate level. I’m convinced that a narrow focus is important because even most great books try to do too much at once. They discuss beginner, intermediate, and advanced strategies and evaluate various options depending on different primary goals (muscle gains, strength gains, etc.). <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This makes it hard to find those lessons that are directly relevant for you.</p>
<p>So, if after all these disclaimers, you still think that this book might be a good fit for you, without any further ado, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>With some practice, it’s quite easy to invent a convincing story that supports any point you want to make. We will talk about several examples in Section <a href="#ch:basichandles" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ch:basichandles">3</a>.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>Books are often used primarily to demonstrate expertise. This works best if the book is hard to understand since this shows how smart the author is. In other words, most books are written for the author not the reader. The strategy is that people just give up and say: "okay fine, you know your stuff and I’m confused, just tell me what to do."<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>While muscle gains, cardiovascular health, athleticism, functional fitness, and strength gains are not necessarily mutually exclusive, it’s simply impossible to optimize in various directions at once. There’s always a trade-off. Thus you need to decide what your primary focus is. And if it isn’t muscle gains, you’re probably better off by reading a different book. For example, if you primarily want to get really strong, you should read a book on powerlifting. Or if you want to prioritize functional fitness, it probably makes more sense if you sign up for some functional fitness course at your local gym.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
