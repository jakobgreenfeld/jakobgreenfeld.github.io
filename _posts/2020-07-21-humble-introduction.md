# Humble business ideas - an introduction


Building the first thing that comes to your mind is a horrible strategy. The chances that your first idea is any good is close to zero.

It takes a lot of experience to come up with good ideas on the spot. Experienced entrepreneurs often have trained their idea muscles for years and this allows them to spot good opportunities. 

So, if you're just starting out your first task is to develop effective thinking strategies that allow you to come up with lots of ideas and evaluate their potential. 

Most beginners underestimate the importance of this process and waste months of even years building something that no one wants to pay any money for. A major contributing factor is that, as in any other field, beginners seek advice from the best of the best - the experts who have years of experience and built several multimillion dollar businesses. This is a mistake since the longer you're in a field, the more you suffer from the curse of knowledge. It gets harder and harder to remember the problems you faced as a beginner. This is why many experts give horrible advice to beginners. A successful serial entrepreneur will have trained his business idea muscle for years so, of course, coming up with good ideas is a non-issue for her. 

This is where advice such as "ideas are cheap, execution is everything" is coming from. For experienced entrepreneurs this might be good advice since they've internalized all kinds of thinking strategies that allow them to weed out bad ideas before they enter their conscious thoughts. 

Moreover, of course, with enough perseverance, skill and capital you can probably squeeze some money out of any idea, no matter how bad it is. But if you start with a bad idea, you'll make things unnecessarily hard for yourself. Executing on a bad idea is like running uphill. Sure, it's doable. But it's certainly not enjoyable and there are simpler routes you could take. 

The totally unscientific formula for this idea-execution relationship looks like this:

Idea x Execution = Returns


The bottom line is this: with a bit of experience and deliberate practice you too will never run out of good business ideas. Instead, the limiting factors will become your time and capital. But if you're just starting, you need to spend some time to learn how you can come up with and identify valuable ideas. This is what we'll discuss in the following parts in this series. 

- The first part is dedicated to question if you should focus on startup ideas or on more humble business ideas.
- In the second part, we talk about frameworks and strategies to come up with and evaluate concrete business ideas.
- In the third and final part, we'll zoom in even further and discuss how you can transform abstract ideas into tangible ideas.
