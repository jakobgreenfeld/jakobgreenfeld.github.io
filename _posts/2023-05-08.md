Clarity is the ultimate superpower.

If you know exactly what your mission is and what you need to do to achieve your goals, you will find it easy to take the necessary steps. You will stop procrastinating and build momentum day after day.

To a large extent, clarity comes from fast decisions, a bias for action, and the habit of closing open loops.

But there’s another key factor.

You have to take care of your mind. In short, the tidier you keep your attentional space, the more clearly you think.

Like everyone else nowadays I used to immediately put on my headphones when I left the house and started listening to some podcast or audiobook. I used the 30 seconds I was waiting for the elevator to check my emails. And of course, I always browsed Twitter or Reddit when I went to the toilet.

My mind craves distractions and I used to give it what it wants.

Only recently I realized just how harmful these seemingly innocent habits are.

Slowly but steadily my thoughts became muddier. I started experiencing brain fog. For the first time in my life, I wasn’t sure what to do next.

And all of these symptoms went away once I started taking better care of my attentional space.

Attentional space is a term used to describe the scratch pad in our brain that we use to temporarily store information as it's being processed.

If you give in to your impulses, you will constantly fill your attentional space to the brim.

This happens for evolutionary reasons analogous to how we’re always tempted to overeat. And just like daily overeating, daily overstimulation leads to all kinds of (mental) health issues.

It’s not just overeating. The kind of signals you let into your attentional space matter a lot, just as it matters a lot what you eat.

Intellectual junk food like most TikTok videos, Tweets, or YouTube videos has a similarly devastating effect as regular junk food.

There are 3 strategies you can use to get your sanity back.

## Passive Defragmentation

Back in the day computers came with software called Disk Defragmenter. It was recommended that you run the program regularly to make sure the computer doesn’t become too slow.

What the software did behind the scenes is dutifully rearrange the discontiguous blocks of files so they would be physically closer on the drive. This made the computer faster since when the files are properly organized on the drive, it takes less time to open them.

Something similar happens when you leave enough room in your attentional space. After some boot-up time, your mind will start dutifully rearranging the discontiguous blocks it has stored. In other words, we defragment our thoughts when we carve out space between tasks.

A lot of it happens beyond the surface but you can glimpses of what’s going on by noting how seemingly random thoughts start popping into and out of your awareness.

If you leave enough room in your attentional space so that this process runs regularly, your thinking will improve significantly.

And as if this wasn’t already cool enough, there’s lots of other good stuff going on.

A byproduct of the defragmentation process is that your mind tries all kinds of combinations of how different thoughts fit together. If there’s enough room left in our attentional space, we naturally begin to connect the scattered dots we’ve collected.

This is where novel insights and ideas come from.

There’s a reason why Bed, Bath, and Bus are called the Three B’s of Creativity. These used to be the only places where people’s attentional space remained empty enough. (Nowadays, waterproof smartphones that we keep using while we lay in bed kind of ruin these places.)

Another related process is that our mind starts generating simulations of possible future events.

If you leave enough space for these kinds of simulations to run regularly, making plans and deciding what to do will become a lot easier.

I’m still tempted to fill every single second of my day with some kind of stimulation. But instead of giving in to these impulses, I now think: “Nope, better give my mind some space to defragment”.

Once you understand what’s going on, it’s actually fun to observe how it happens. It’s not just random thoughts popping up but your brain being hard at work to clean things up for you!

And the most rewarding feeling of all is of course when you notice how much the quality of your thoughts improves over time.

Leaving enough room in your attentional space is by far the most important factor to clear up your thinking.

## Active Defragmentation

There’s an incredibly powerful way to how actively support your mind’s defragmentation process: journaling.

It allows you to get ideas and thoughts out of your system to make room for new ones. The more stuff we get out of our heads, the more clearly we think.

Lots of ideas are hiding in the shadows and only come to light once your fingers hit the keyboard. And once you’re able to see them in bright daylight, your relationship to them changes instantaneously once.

Oftentimes even the scariest thoughts look rather innocent once written down.

I don’t think it matters how you journal as long as you do it in some form. Some people simply write down whatever is on their minds every single morning.

My approach is to wait until I feel the strong urge, usually when I’m confused, to write about a specific topic and then start writing to clear things up.

Another method to actively defragment your mind is, you probably guessed it, meditation.

Meditation is simply the process of actively leaving as much room as possible in your attentional space. Then you observe your thoughts pop into and out of your mind like an indifferent third-person observer.

As with journaling, the details don’t matter much. The most important factor is that you do it and do it regularly.

## Clean Up Your Information Diet

Living in a completely white room without any form of external stimulation definitely wouldn’t be healthy. We need external inputs to stay creative and productive.

However, not all external inputs are equally valuable. The quality of your thoughts largely depends on what you choose to focus on.

If you defend your attentional space religiously, allowing only the most valuable dots to be encoded, you will start having thoughts at a completely new level.

Small actions like regularly "marie kondoing” (”does it spark joy?”) the list of people you follow on Twitter and the newsletters you subscribe to already have a huge impact.

Think of your attentional space as a garden. Every piece of content you consume is a seed you plant. Just in a real garden, focus on planting flowers and crops.

Just as you are what you eat, when it comes to the information you consume, you are what you choose to focus on.

Almost nothing influences your productivity and creativity as much as the information you’re consuming.
