Like everyone else nowadays I used to immediately put on my headphones when I left the house and started listening to some podcast or audiobook. I used the 30 seconds I was waiting for the elevator to check my emails. And of course, I always browsed Twitter or Reddit when I went to the toilet. 

My mind craves distractions and I used to give it what it wants. 

Only recently I realized just how harmful these seemingly innocent habits are. 

Slowly but steadily my thoughts became muddier. I started experiencing brain fog. For the first time in my life I wasn’t sure what to do next.

And all of these symptoms went away once I started taking better care of my attentional space. 

## Attentional Space?

Attentional space is a term used to describe the scratch pad in our brain that we use to temporarily store information as it's being processed.

If you give in to your impulses, you will constantly fill your attentional space to the brim.

This happens for evolutionary reasons analogous to how we’re always tempted to overeat. And just like daily overeating, daily overstimulation leads to all kinds of (mental) health issues.  

It’s not just overeating. The kind of signals you let into your attentional space matter a lot, just how it matters a lot what you eat. 

Intellectual junk food like most TikTok videos, Tweets, or YouTube videos has a similarly devastating effect as regular junk food. 

TODO BILD

Here are the 4 strategies I used to successfully get my sanity back. 

## Passive Defragmentation

Back in the days computers came with a software called Disk Defragmenter. It was recommended that you run the program regularly to make sure the computer doesn’t become too slow. 

What the software did behind the scenes is dutifully rearrange the discontiguous blocks of files so they would be physically closer on the drive. **This made the computer faster since when the files are properly organised on the drive, it takes less time to open them. 

Something similar happens when you leave enough room in your attentional space. After some boot-up time, you mind will start dutifully rearranging the discontiguous blocks it has stored. In other words, we defragment our thoughts when we carve out space between tasks.

A lot of it happens beyond the surface but you can glimpses of what’s going on by noting how seemingly random thoughts start popping into and out of your awareness. 

If you leave enough room in your attentional space so that this process runs regularly, your thinking will improve significantly. 

And as if this wasn’t already cool enough, there’s lots of other good stuff going on. 

A byproduct of the defragmentation process is that your mind tries all kinds of combinations how different thoughts fit together. If there’s enough room left in our attentional space, **we naturally begin to connect the scattered dots we’ve collected*.*

This is where novel insights and ideas come from. 

There’s a reason why Bed, Bath, and Bus are called the Three B’s of Creativity. These used to be the only places where people’s attentional space remained empty enough. (Nowadays, waterproof smartphones that we keep using while we lay in bed kind of ruined these places.)

Another related process is that our mind starts generating simulations of possible future events. 

If you leave enough space for these kinds of simulations to run regularly, making plans and deciding what to do will become a lot easier.

I’m still tempted to fill every single second of my day with some kind of stimulation. But instead of giving in to these impulses, I now think: “Nope, better give my mind some space to defragment”. 

Once you understand what’s going on, it’s actually fun to observe how it happens. It’s not just random thoughts popping up but your brain being hard at work to clean things up for you! 

And the most rewarding feeling of all is of course when you notice how much the quality of your thoughts improve over time. 

Leaving enough room in your attentional space is by far the most important factor to clear up your thinking. But there are 4 tactics that help me keep my attentional space tidy.

Let’s talk about them next. 

## Active Defragmentation

There’s an incredibly powerful way to how actively support your minds defragmentation process: journaling.

It allows you to get ideas and thoughts out of your system to make room for new ones. The more stuff we get out of our heads, the more clearly we think.

Lots of ideas are hiding in the shadows and only come to light once your fingers hit the keyboard. And once you’re able to see them in bright daylight, your relationship to them changes instantaneously once.

Oftentimes even the scariest thoughts look rather innocent once written down. 

I don’t think it matters how you journal as long as you do it on some form. Some people simply write down whatever is on their mind every single morning. 

My approach is to wait until I feel the strong urge, usually when I’m confused, to write about a specific topic and then start writing to clear things up. 

Another method to actively defragment your mind is, you probably guessed it, meditation. 

Meditation is simply the process of actively leaving as much room as possible in your attentional space. Then you observer your thoughts pop into and out of your mind like an indifferent third-person observer.

As with journaling, the details don’t matter much. The most important factor is that you do it and do it regularly. 

## Close Open Loops

The problem with open loops is that they pollute our attentional space. 

Your mind will remind you at random intervals about very unanswered email in your inbox, every unfinished project.

Even worse are open loops that are only stored in your brain. You’ll always be afraid of forgetting about them and hence your brain will send reminders all the time. 

The good news is that there are easy solutions to that immediately will clear up even more of your attentional space. 

The first key habit is to use a quick capture inbox. I personally like to send Telegram messages to myself as it’s by far the fastest app on my phone but any note-taking app will do. 

There’s zero structure. All that matters is to have a way to save things as quickly and frictionless as possible everywhere I go.

I simply write down all fleeting ideas and thoughts that seem worth remembering. I also save all interesting links, tweets, and resources I come across.

While using a quick capture inbox is definitely a step in the right direction, your brain will still be tempted to pollute your attentional space with reminders. After all, the fact that you stored these ideas and thoughts someone doesn’t mean that you won’t forget about them. 

This is where the second key habit comes in: a weekly review. 

Every Sunday I clean my quick capture inbox completely. I go through every single item I’ve saved and decide what to do with it. Many get deleted as they only seemed interesting in the heat of the moment. Others end up in the todo list for next week, and some items become drafts in my Notion essay database. 

I also go through all unfinished tasks on my todo list and either delete them or also add them to todo list for next week

This usually takes less than 20 minutes and gives me complete peace of mind during the week. I have complete confidence that I won’t forget anything important and hence there is zero need for my brain to send any kind of reminders. 

Another thing I do every Sunday is to get to inbox zero. The thing about emails is that your brain will subconsciously try to craft responses for all of them until you make a final decision. This clocks up a lot of mental bandwidth. 

Hence as part of my weekly review, I go through all emails in my inbox and make a final decision. I either write an immediate response or, if I still don’t feel like answering it, archive it. 

Few things give me peace of mind like completely empty email and quick capture inboxes. 

## Clean Up Your Information Diet

Living in a completely white room without any form of external stimulation definitely wouldn’t be healthy. We need external inputs to stay creative and productive. 

However, not all external inputs are equally valuable. The quality of your thoughts largely depends on what you choose to focus on. 

If you defend your attentional space religiously, allowing only the most valuable dots to be encoded, you will start having thoughts at a completely new level. 

Small actions like regularly "marie kondoing” (”does it spark joy?”) the list of people you following on Twitter and the newsletters you subscribe to already have a huge impact.

Think of your attentional space as a garden. Every piece of content you consume is a seed you plant. Just in a real garden, focus on planting flowers and crops.
