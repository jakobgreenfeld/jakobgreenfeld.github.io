Every day I'm writing down 10 ideas.

Sometimes I write down ideas for growing my agency. Sometimes I write down ideas for new stuff to try in my city. Sometimes I write down ideas for blog posts. And sometimes I just write down any random ideas that pop into my head.

I'm not trying to come up with good ideas. I'm just trying to come up with ideas.

I consider this my daily idea muscle workout. And it's working. 

Whenever I need to come up with ideas, I can do it much faster now.

I'm also much more likely to notice good ideas when they come up since I'm seeing so many ideas every day.

But there is one idea habit that I love even more.

Every day I'm sharing at least one idea. 

Sometimes I'm sharing it on Twitter. Sometimes I'm sharing it on my blog. But most of the time I'm writing an email, often to strangers.

Why?

Because it brings more luck into my life. People appreciate when you share your ideas with them without asking for anything in return. 

It also provides me feedback on my ideas. It's very easy to get lost in your own head. But when you share your ideas, you get to see how the world reacts to them.

And it brings into existence the kind of world I want to live in.

There are of course people who will get mad at you for sharing your ideas.

"Who do you think you are?"

Ignore them. They are not the kind of people you want to be around anyway.

The most interesting people in the world will appreciate you for sharing your ideas.

Yesterday I shared ideas with the CEO of my favorite coffee house chain, the founder of a software I recently unsubscribed from, and guy whose blog post I really liked this week.

Every single one of them replied to my email and thanked me for sharing my ideas with them.
