80%+ of all startup founders fail but from what I've seen the number for indie makers is much, much higher. 

Over the past 18 months I've seen so many people come and go.

Today I reflected on why this happens:

## Lack of commitment

Most indie makers are neither fully committed to entrepreneurship nor to a specific project.

When you're doing it part-time, there's always an easy way out when things get tough. 

It's also much easier to always hop to a shiny new project as an indie maker.

## Lack of collaborations

Collaborating seems like such a no-brainer in many cases. But most indie makers prefer to do it solo. 

Why? 

Joining forces w/ someone means commitment. Also, unwillingness to commit to a single project means most collaborations don't work out.
Lack of support structures

For startup founders, there are advisors, mentors, accelerators, and board of directors that hold them accountable. 

For indie makers... there's Twitter. 

There are also "communities" but most either die or become filled with self-promotional spam.

## Lack of a game plan

Most indie makers never take the time to come up with a game plan. Hence their projects are doomed to fail since there is no clear market, value prop story, and gtm strategy.

Startup founders are forced to think about this when they prepare their pitch deck

At the moment, I don't have any viable solutions to these problems. So if you have any ideas, please shoot me a message.
