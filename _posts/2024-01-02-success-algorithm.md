First of all, you have to understand what sucess means to you. 

You can start with a rather vague definition like "build a good life".

Then you apply **specificity**.

As an example, let's say that making $20k/month without working crazy hours is part of your definition of a good life. Having 3 great friends, an amazing family, etc. could be other parts of it. 

Now equipped with your specific goals, you start **working backwards**. You need to develop a [theory of change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange).

<"A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action â€” it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it."

How are people making $20k/month?

Do your research. Evalulate all the options for their pros and cons.

Let's say the result of your research is that owning a cash-flowing digital service business is the best option.

Okay, now what?

You're still not done working backwards.

How exactly are people starting cash-flowing digital service businesses? What are the steps they took that got them from $0 to $20k/month in profit?

Find stories like [this one](https://www.rpdoyle.com/blog/a-successful-year) from people who have successfully done the exact thing you're trying to do. 

Read all of them. 

Then write down the patterns and come up with a step-by-step plan. There will be different playbooks. Evaluate again the pros and cons. Then pick the one that has the highest success chances because it's coming from trustworthy sources and matches your personal skillset and preferences.

Now how do you start executing?

Focus on whatever part of the plan is [most likely to fail](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/ResearchasaStochasticDecisionProcess.html) first. 

For business endevours it's useful to consider market risks and execution risks. However, for service businesses there is usually little execution risk.

The number one reason why service businesses fail is that they're unable to find customers for their offer.

So that's what you should focus on first here. If you can't solve that part of the puzzle, everything else becomes irrelevant.
