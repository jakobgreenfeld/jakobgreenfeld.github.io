There are tons of people giving advice on how to build an agency. But most of it will actually stall your growth and cause issues left and right.

The problem is that everyone is using the same word "agency" to describe completely different things.

There are four different agency games. And you have to know which one you are playing.

This will not only make it much easier to build your agency, but also to know what advice to follow and what to ignore.

First of all, there is of course the freelancers in disguise approach. They are not really an agency. They are just one freelancer or a couple of freelancers who are labeling themselves as an agency. 

But what they're really doing is just selling their time. They are not really building a business. They are creating an (often well-paid) job for themselves.

Then there are the agencies who are playing what I'm calling the McDonalds game.

You hire an army of cheap VAs, write tons of bulletproof SOPs, and then charge a reasonably low price for your services. 

This only works if you are laser focused on a specific niche and have a straight-forward process for delivering value. Your service delivery will not be world-class, but it will be good enough for many clients.

Another popular approach is the arbitrage game. Your value prop is usually a bit vague. Your goal is to get into conversations with as many companies as possibles. 

Once you're in a conversations you're putting out your feelers for what they could need help with. 

Then you position yourself as the perfect solution to their pain points during the conversation.

After the call you reach out to your trusted network of freelancers and agencies and find someone who can deliver the service. Then you put together a proposal with a nice margin and send it over to the client.

This approach is not really scalable but it's a great way to generate cashflow fast.

The third approach is the boutique agency, or what I like to call the Four Seasons approach. You are not competing on price. You are competing on quality. 

You built a team of A-players and you are charging a premium for your services. You are focused on a specific type of service and have solid systems. Your service delivery is not custom for every client but can be customized when needed.

When we started [our agency](https://sales.co) we had no clarity on which game we were playing. We were trying to do a little bit of everything. 

However, we quickly learned that the McDonalds approach was not for us. You have to love micro-managing to make it work.

Also trading our time for money is not what we wanted to do. We wanted to build a business that can scale and eventually run without us.

So what we eventually settled down after many iterations is the Four Seasons approach.

But just to be clear, every approach can work. It's just a matter of personal preferences.

There are wildly successful agencies in every category.

The most important thing is that you get clear on which game you are playing. And once you know, only listen to people who have actually built the kind of agency you want to build.

They can be in completely different niches. That doesn't matter. As long as they're playing the same game as you, you can learn a lot from them.
