If you want mediocre results, try to balance things.

Each day, try to work a little bit, then learn something, then have some fun. Try to reduce your social media consumption to a few minutes each day, only watch one or two Netflix episodes, and eat mostly healthy food. 

But if you want exceptional results, you can't balance things. You have to do them totally or don't do them at all.  

Don't consume any social media content, don't watch Netflix, and never eat unhealthy food. 

If you decide it's time to learn, learn totally. Don't do anything else and make it your singular focus. 

If you decide it's time to create, create totally. Don't do anything else and make it your singular focus. 

If you decide it's time to have fun, do it totally and without regrets.
