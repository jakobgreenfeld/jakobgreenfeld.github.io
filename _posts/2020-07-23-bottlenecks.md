title: Code and design are no longer bottlenecks

The number one reason that's stopping aspiring software entrepreneurs is the thought that they'll eventually have to build the product they envision and have no idea how to make it happen. 

But this fear of building is nowadays  completely unjustified. Long gone are the times when code and design were the bottlenecks. The dirty little secret most developers don't want you to know is that you can easily build a minimum viable product using no-code tools or hire someone cheaply. And even if you want to build your product yourself, there isn't much you have to learn before you can build something solid. 

Of course, many developers will try to make you believe that coding is still an immensely difficult task that's better left to a priestly caste. They will throw all kinds of jargon around and argue that a three-year-long curriculum is necessarily before you can build something useful. They will try to convince you to use bloated tools and to follow unnecessarily complex principles. After all, that's the only way they can sustain their expert status. 

Don't get me wrong. Certainly not all programming tasks are simple and coding is definitely a skill that needs years to master. However, the first few versions of 99.9% of all products don't require expert-level skills. And even if, against all odds, your product becomes so big of a success that more sophisticated technologies become necessary, that's a great problem to have! At this point you'll have enough money to hire someone or enough motivation to rewrite it properly yourself. In contrast, if you polish each product right from the start so that it could, hypothetically, be served to millions of users simultaneously, chances are high that you'll never reach that stage anyway.

Similar things can be said about design. For most purposes established design frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind are completely sufficient and no expert-level design skills are necessary to create a great-looking product.

While full-time designers and coders might not like to hear this, for entrepreneurs this is great news. 

Of course, [successful entrepreneurship](/humble_vs_startups) is still far from easy. However, instead of four bottlenecks, there are just two left:

- [Ideation](/ideation) (i.e. coming up with great ideas that are worth executing) and
- Marketing.

This is what software entrepreneurs nowadays should focus on.
