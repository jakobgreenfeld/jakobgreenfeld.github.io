title: How to come up with humble business ideas?

The bad news is, there's not some magical formula you can use to come up with good business ideas. However, the good news is, you're not operating in a vacuum and there are plenty of ways to look for inspiration. You don't have to retreat to some cave and stare at its walls until the perfect idea hits you. Instead, recognize that everything's a remix and that most totally unique ideas have a far too small chance at success to be useful for humble business entrepreneurs.

“Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.”

There are two broad strategies to come up with ideas: active ideation and passive ideation. 

Passive ideation means that you record, store, and sort ideas that come to you when you're not actively looking for ideas. For example, you might notice in the gym how annoying it is that you always seem to come at the wrong times when all the machines you want to use are occupied. Sparked by this observation an app idea that solves this problem pops into your mind.

In contrast, active ideation means that you sit at a desk and actively try to come up with good ideas by answering concrete questions and doing research.

Both strategies can lead to great ideas and ideally, you should implement both. 

## **Passive Ideation**

Passive ideation is necessary if you want to make sure that you'll never again run out of ideas. The key is to make it a habit to collect all of your business ideas in a central repository that I like to call the "idea inbox". Good ideas can come from everywhere and pop into your mind at any place and time. Whenever you have an idea, write it down immediately. This has multiple benefits:

- By writing your ideas down, you make sure that you don't forget any one of them.
- Writing ideas down frees up mental capacities and allows to generate even more ideas.
- Only by getting ideas from your head onto the screen you can see them for what they truly are. Many ideas only seem great as long as they're fuzzy and vague concepts in your head. If you revisit your idea list after a while, you'll be able to see them as if they were written by someone else and thus judge their value objectively.
- Often, as soon as you start writing an idea down, you'll have several related ideas. As Morgan Housel puts: "Your best ideas are hiding in the shadows. They’ll come to light once your fingers hit the keyboard."

If no ideas come passively to you, it can make a lot of sense to implement a deliberate practice that allows you to train your idea muscle. For example, a simple but effective practice is to force yourself to write down 5 ideas each morning no matter how stupid they are. If you do this for a while, your ideas get better and better and you'll have more of them thorough the day.

Additionally, by going through a few active ideation strategies you can learn what kind of ideas you should be looking for in your daily life. Moreover, while the best ideas usually appear when you're least expecting it (i. e. passively), this only happens if you prepare your mind accordingly. And, of course, if you want to build something *now*, the advice given above probably isn't very helpful since it takes time to fill your idea inbox passively.

Thus, let's talk about active ideation strategies next.

## **Active Ideation**

First of all, take note that all the ideas that you generate actively should also end up in your idea inbox.

It is essential to create some distance between yourself and your ideas. In the heat of the moment many ideas appear much better than they really are. After letting them sit for a week or two in your inbox, you can start to evaluate them more objectively. We'll discuss later how exactly you can do that.

With that out of the way, let's talk about active ways to generate humble business ideas that are particularly useful for beginners. 

We'll start by talking about several general considerations that can help you come up with ideas. 

### Focus on Problems and Pains

Most beginner ideas fall into the category "nice to have". They try to have clever ideas. Avoid these at all costs. You'll have an incredibly hard to convince people to pay money for something that is only "nice to have". 

Instead, focus on solutions for problems and pains. If you're able to solve a real problem that other people are aware of with your product in a reliable and convenient way, your product will sell itself. 

Another common error is that beginners try to find creative problems that no one else is solving. Usually, there is a good reason why this is the case. As a humble business entrepreneur it's not just job to discover why.

A much smarter strategy is to focus on problems many people are already aware of and solve it in a better, cheaper, simpler, or more convenient way. Don't be discouraged if there are already a few other products that target the same problem. The existence of these products only validates that there is a real problem and that people are willing to spend money for a solution to it. So while it is a bad sign if there are no products that target the problem you have in mind, it's also a problem if there are already hundreds of products. You shouldn't open another pizza shop in a street with 20 other pizza shops. But if there's just one or two pizza shops that are getting a lot of customers it might be worth a try.

There are many angles you can take to stand out. For example:

- Build something simpler and cheaper that focuses exclusively on the core problem. A good example is [https://pinboard.in/](https://pinboard.in/) that managed to stand out in the overcrowded bookmarking market.
- Build something privacy focused. Examples include Fathom and Simple Analytics.

But what problems exactly should you focus on? And how can you identify them? 

In short, to find problems worth solving, oftentimes the best strategy is to take note of things that you find problematic. This is what we'll talk about next.

### **Scratch your own itch.**

Many humble businesses solve a problem of the founder. This is a great strategy because if you look at your own problems, it means that your looking at things that are bothering real persons  and not something completely hypothetical. If you have a problem, chances are extremely high that others have it too. And since you'll be your products first real customer, you will be able to iterate much more effectively. If you build for yourself, you’ll always have product-market fit.

In contrast, if you try to solve a problem that isn't yours, chances are high that you're focusing on a non-issue. It's completely unrealistic to solve an industries' problems as a complete outsider without specific domain knowledge.  

As a college student you won't be able write a software that revolutionizes the way doctors prescribe medicine. Your software might be useful but it won't make any money unless you understand the structure and economics of the healthcare industry. You need to find a way to integrate your software with the multitude of Electronic Medical Record systems. You need to understand who really would be able to make more money using your software.

You could, of course, try to conduct surveys to find out what kind of problems people in a given industry are struggling with. (This is known as idea extraction.) However, the best ideas come from observing what people do, and not by listening to what they say (*cough* faster horses).  And you can only observe what is going on in an industry as insider.  As an outsider you typically only see the tip of the iceberg. This is why outsiders usually fail.

Oftentimes, people say that they would pay money for something if you ask them, but when the product then becomes available they aren't prepared to spend money on it. For examples, doctors might say that they, of course, would love to use your software since they have the best interests of their patients in mind. But when you then try to sell the first version to them, you'll find out that they're not willing to pay any money for it. After all, patients don't pay more money or come back more often to doctors who prescribe better pills. Hence your software is merely a nice-to-have and they can't justify the expense.

Hence, especially as a complete beginner, you should try to scratch your own itch before you conduct sophisticated surveys to come up with new ideas. (Once you got some experience doing surveys can, of course, be a valuable strategy as long as you ask the right kind of questions which is an art in itself.)

Here are some questions to get you started:

- What is a process in your life where you regularly think: "That could be so much easier."?
- For what kind of service do you pay too much money for?
- What kind of service do you use that could be much simpler and would be better with fewer features?
- What is something that you use even though it's annoying?
- What kind of workarounds do you currently use?

### Niche it down

An important warning if focus on solving your own problems is that it only works if you focus on aspects of your life that are at least somewhat unique. Far too many beginners try to keep their ideas as general as possible and end up building yet another general purpose todo app, CRM software, bookmark manager (just look at this list: [https://bookmarkos.com/every-bookmark-manager-ever-made/](https://bookmarkos.com/every-bookmark-manager-ever-made/)), or note taking app.

In theory, this strategy makes sense. The bigger the market you target, the higher the chances you'll be able to attract at least a few customers. In reality, this is not how things work. Your product will be a tiny drop in a giant ocean and therefore remain completely invisible. 

But if you niche your idea down and develop, say, a note-taking app for med students who focus on dermatology, chances are high that some of them will take notice. And, as mentioned above, this strategy works especially well if you're a dermatology student yourself. 

The key is to realize how few customers you really need to make a comfortable income and that people are willing to pay a lot more for specialized solutions. For example, to make $5,000 per month you have to

- Sell a $100 product to 50 people,
- Sell a $20 product to 250 people,
- Sell a $10 product to 550 people.

There are almost 8 billion people on this planet. And you just have need to reach 500 of them to sustain your independence.

Niching down in combination with scratching your own itch works best if your not living a 0815 life. 

>To paraphrase Haruki Murakami, if you only do what everyone else is doing, you'll only be able to come up with ideas that everyone else is having. 

Hence, try to identify areas of your life that make you unique by answering questions like the following:

- What makes your background unique? (E.g. "I'm a web designer who first learned Vue.js and then React." This could spark the idea to build a course for others who want to make the jump from Vue.js to React.)
- What makes the way you approach your hobbies unique? (E.g. "I'm regularly lifting weights, I'm primarily interested in looking and feeling great, and I try to achieve my goals by following strategies that are in agreement with the most recent established scientific insights.")
- What kind of knowledge do you have that almost no one else has? (Often this kind of knowledge is found at the intersection of different domains. While it's extremely hard to know something about, say, marketing that rarely anyone else knows, if you're a marketer who also knows how to program well, chances are much higher that you know something about programming that rarely any other marketer knows. Hence, instead of creating yet another Python programming course, you could create a Python programming course for marketers.)
- What subcultures are you part of?

Answering these questions should allow you to come up with at least a few ideas. If, after going through this exercise, you still don't have *any* ideas, it's maybe time to start living a more interesting life. But that's a topic for another day. 

### Try to catch a wave

Not all niched down solutions to your own problems are equally suited to build a humble business around. One of the most important factors that determines you success chances is the market you're operating in. As a humble business owner, you're not trying to create new categories and market desire. This is far too expensive and risky. Instead, you become part of an existing market. Hence it makes a lot of sense to choose the market you will enter wisely.  

Building a business in a shrinking market is like fighting an uphill battle. Possible? Yes. But also unnecessarily difficult. 

The best market for humble business owners is one that already exists, is still small, and about to explode. This scenario is ideal because the market is sufficiently small so that your business will easily be visible. 

If the whole market is a niche, there is no reason to niche down. For example, there was no need to build crypto chart API for former wall street traders since crypto chart API was already a niche. Nowadays, as crypto moves into the mainstream and you're entering the market rather late, it is necessary to niche down. Similarly, in 2014 it was a perfectly valid strategy to build a general platform for digital nomads. Nowadays, as a humble business owner you need to focus on something more specific like a bookkeeping tool for digital nomads that work as illustrators. 

And while it may not be possible to make a lot of money as long as the whole market is a niche, your profit often will grow in direct relationship to the market growth. To quote the founder of Gumroad, Sahil Lavingia: "The market you’re in will determine most of your growth." 

Thus if you want to come up with good humble business ideas, it makes a lot of sense to [monitor upcoming trends](/trends). Three websites that can help you doing this are:

- [https://treendly.com/](https://treendly.com/)
- [https://explodingtopics.com/](https://explodingtopics.com/)
- [https://meetglimpse.com/](https://meetglimpse.com/)

Similarly, you can monitor websites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Pozible.com, [https://www.ulule.com/](https://www.ulule.com/) to get an idea of what kind of *physical* products are currently hot. For software products, have a look at Producthunt, [https://stack.g2.com/](https://stack.g2.com/), and [https://trends.builtwith.com/](https://trends.builtwith.com/). Additionally, you can look at TechCrunch to see what kind of companies are currently getting lots of funding. If there are currently lots of winners in a certain space, chances are high that there's room for another.

But please, don't jump blindly onto every hypetrain that comes along. Instead, look for trends that excite you and where you feel like you can contribute something meaningful.  Ask yourself:

- What kind of upcoming trends do I find exciting?
- What am I doing that currently almost no one else does that has the potential to become a mainstream thing?
- And what can I do to help it achieve mainstream adoption faster?

### Sell Pickaxes

Another useful "internal script" you can implement to come up with good humble business ideas, is to look for goldrushs (trends full of people with dollar signs in their eyes) and then try to come up with ways [to sell pickaxes](/pickax).

It so much easier to sell a product if it helps others earn more money. Each customer can easily calculate that your product costs X but it will help him earn at least Y. If Y is bigger than X, it becomes a no-brainer to buy your product.

>Examples of recent gold rushs and pickaxes are:
>- venture capital → build data aggregators that allows VCs to identify worthwhile investments
>- coaching → courses and tools for coaches in a specific niche
>- crypto → tools for crypto traders
>- AI → tools for people who want to sell AI services to businesses
>- online courses → tools and courses for course creators

But don't just stop there. At some point, the pickax market will become the new goldrush and it's time to sell heads and handles to the pickax sellers. Usually that means selling specialized data or ideas.

If you believe that selling heads and handles to pickax sellers is ridiculous, just consider what [builtwith.com](http://builtwith.com/) is doing (which by the way is a perfect example of a humble business that nevertheless grew big).

In summary, an ideal humble business idea 

1. solves a problem
2. you have yourself
3. in a niche you're active in
4. which has the potential to gain mainstream adoption in the near future
5. and targets gold miners.

Try to think along these lines when you're trying to find business ideas. Of course, less-then-optimal ideas can work perfectly well too. But it certainly doesn't hurt to try to come up with the best ideas you can if you're just starting out since this will help you get into the habit of developing good or even great ideas.

Next, we'll discuss how you can quantify if the ideas you've come up with so far are any good and which idea you should focus on.

PS: Another useful way to develop business ideas is the [framework proposed by Peter Askew](https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/). The gist of it is: just buy a great domain name and go from there. Browsing through expiring domain names or domains that are for sale can be a great way to get into a creative mode. However, while doing this, you shouldn't forget the points mentioned above about scratching your own itch and solving real problems.
