title: How to quantify the potential of humble business ideas

Valuing business opportunities is not a science, it's an art. Every valuation necessarily relies on subjective judgements and formulas. But this doesn't mean that frameworks for evaluating business ideas are useless. As we'll see below, they can provide invaluable decision guidance. Without a proper framework it's far too easy to get excited about ideas that aren't promising from a more objective point of view.

I'll propose a specific framework. But please, don't take it for granted. Modify it however you want. As you gain more experience, you'll inevitably disagree with many of my judgements. That's awesome! Please come up with your own criteria and formulas. I'd love if there were a menu of frameworks beginners can use to evaluate their ideas. 

My proposal is that you rate each of the ideas in your idea inbox according to the following five criteria on a scale from 1 (bad) to 5 (optimal):

- How painful is the problem you're trying to solve? (5= a solution significantly improves the life of customers, 1=a solution would be nice to have)
- How well equipped are you to solve it? (5= I know everything I need to solve the problem, 1= I currently don't have any technical skills related to the problem.)
- How certain are you that people are willing to pay money for a solution? (5= there is at least one direct competitor that makes a significant amount of money, 1= no competitor exists that makes any money.)
- How optimal is the market size? ( 6= around 10000 potential customers, 1= billions or just a few potential customers. If the market is too large this is a sign that you need to niche down more.)
- How healthy is the market? (5= rising trend with huge potential and just one or two competitor, 1 = shrinking and oversaturated)

I would say that the second criteria in this list is the least important. Humble products are often easy to build and thus it shouldn't be too difficult to learn what is necessary to build it. Hence, a good way to rephrase it if you're currently lacking the technical skills (writing, programming, etc.) to build products is "How motivated are you to learn what is necessary to build the solution?".

Note that there's no need to do intensive market research. Your numbers will always remain guesses. Just do a few quick Google searches to find information about the market and potential competitors and then listen to your gut feeling. Moreover, while you, of course, should have some rough idea how you can actually solve the problem and how you'll be able to earn money doing so, you don't need to spend much time thinking about these details at this stage. If there are competitors that have successfully solved the problem and make some money, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to do the same. 

To help you rate your ideas, I've created a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N7bRRRSBQ6LDRq8jj5XbwcZhTqC12Ud4-YzI43HKrCI/copy?usp=sharing).



Please rate your ideas now. I'll wait.

Once you've rated all of your ideas, the next step is to move all ideas with rating above 15 from the idea inbox to a new list that is labelled "good ideas". All other ideas get archived.

I personally use Notion to collect ideas and sort them but other tools like Trello work equally well.

If, after all the steps outlined above and, say, two weeks of passive ideation, you still don't feel like you've found the perfect idea, it's time to stop worrying and get moving. Executing a less-then-optimal idea is far better than to remain in a state of analysis paralysis. Once you're working on a concrete product, you will spot dozens of new business opportunities. In fact, most doors will only open once you're moving. So feel free to lower the threshold from 15 to, say 12. 

In any case, for the ideas you identified as "good", the next step is to find out how exactly you can build you solution and how difficult it will be to build the solution you have in mind.  This is what we'll talk about next.
