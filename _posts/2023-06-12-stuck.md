If you’re struggling to get your business off the ground and to a meaningful revenue level, it’s usually because you’re focusing on a bad opportunity. The only way out is to pivot toward a more promising opportunity.

Met a guy running a CRO agency who is still doing user interviews even though he hates doing them. Another guy I met is running a super successful local web hosting company. And he’s still doing customer support for several hours every week. He absolutely hates doing that. So why is he still doing it? Because he’s afraid their TrustPilot rating will go down otherwise when the support quality drops even a little bit.
