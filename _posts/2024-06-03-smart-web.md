The dumb web is created by people who are convinced that people on the internet are idiots.

You can easily fool them with AI-generated garbarge, manipulate them with cheap tricks, make them buy stuff they don't need with fake reviews.

They can't think for themselves or understand nuance. 

Better to show them absolute garbage on a site like Forbes than risking exposing them to anything that could make them think.

All they want is content that confirms their existing beliefs or distracts them.

Trump this, Jake Paul that, 5 easy steps, ooh look at *that* cat.

It's listicles, clickbait, and regurgitated nonsense.

The dumb web is created by committees, fueled by ad dollars, and run by algorithms.

It's vanilla, boring, and, well, dumb.

The smart web still exists. But it's increasingly hard to find.

Most of [Google's search results](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240524-how-googles-new-algorithm-will-shape-your-internet) is dumb web content.

Social media platforms eventually all turn into [dumb web machine like TikTok](https://playpermissionless.substack.com/p/twitter-is-now-attention-roulette).

It often feels like the whole world is trying to push dumb web content down your throat.

Unless you put up defense mechanisms, it can easily seem like the dumb web is all there is.

But there is plenty of smart content on the web.

You just have to find it and keep reminding yourself that it's out there.

Discoverability of smart web content relies on word of mouth and [human curation](https://www.visakanv.com/blog/bookmarks/).

While the dumb web screams, the smart web whispers.

You navigate throught the smart web one link, one recommendation at a time. Unlike in the dumb web, links in the smart web are still meaningful. When a smart web site links to another site, it's worth clicking.

In contrast, in the dumb web, links are exlusively used strategically. You gotta protect your precious SEO juice or sell them to the highest bidder. Links solely exist for robots. Please stick to the content the algorithm recommends, ok?

The smart web is created by individuals, fueled by donations, subscriptions, and curiosity.

It's powered by RSS, HTML, and email.

It's blogs and newsletters.

It's [long-form](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), [courageous](https://idlewords.com/2012/09/no_evidence_of_disease.htm), [weird](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/taylor-swift-does-not-exist), and [idiosyncratic](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/). 

It's [earned](https://tynan.com/workonwhat/) [insights](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/what-the-humans-like-is-responsiveness), [original](https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/) [thoughts](https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/26/kairos/), [first-hand](https://blog.tjcx.me/p/40k-fantastic-startup-idea)  [experiences](https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/walking-the-world-hanoi-part-1), and [independent](https://aella.substack.com/p/how-relationships-change-over-time) [research](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html), [personal](https://medium.com/@AaronBleyaert/how-to-lose-weight-in-4-easy-steps-1f135f7e1dec) [stories](https://blog.scottbritton.me/p/from-becoming-a-somebody-to-becoming), deep [dives](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/04/19/higher-than-the-shoulders-of-giants-or-a-scientists-history-of-drugs/).

It defies categorization. 

It's [thought-provoking](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/07/25/the-twenty-dollar-swim/), and occasionally [permanently alters](https://sive.rs/ff) [how you see the world](https://web.archive.org/web/20190224043028/http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/the-million-dollar-question).

It's [raw](https://seths.blog/2009/12/fear-of-bad-ideas/), [honest](https://tim.blog/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide/), and [authentic](https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-untethered-soul-the-roadmap-of-my-personal-growth-part-4/).

It's created by humans for humans.

It's about connecting with 10 true friends instead of amassing thousands of anonymous followers.

It's totally unqualified people spending an [irrational amount of time](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/) [exploring](https://julian.digital/2023/07/06/multi-layered-calendars/) [esoteric topics](https://dynomight.net/categories/air-quality/).

It's [good-faith discussions](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/a-theoretical-case-against-education/comments) in [hard-to-navigate forums](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40512500) and comment sections.

It's people [sharing ideas](https://justinjackson.ca/surfing) with the world without expecting anything in return, [following their curiosity](https://alexdanco.com/2021/04/10/world-building/) [with no plan in mind](https://justinmares.substack.com/p/the-next-episode-54).

All of that does exist. 

And you too can be part of it.
