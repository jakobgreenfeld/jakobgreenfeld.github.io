Everyone is infected by the same mind virus.

Symptoms include: laziness, procrastination, and a general lack of discipline when things get tough.

The virus? The idea that you can work smarter instead of harder.

When you're infected by it you tend to say things like "let me think about the different option", "I will ask X about their opinion", "I'll sketch out a plan", or "I need to do some research".

That's precisely how you never get anything meaningful done.

In the time it takes you to think about the different options, you could have already tested them in the real world. 

In the time it takes you to ask someone about their opinion, you could have already tried it and then talk to them about the result.

The mind virus turns any bias for action into a bias for thought and research.

Any instict to press forward when things are not going smoothly is replaced by an instinct to "take a step back" and "re-evaluate".

When things are chaotic, the mind virus makes you "look for smarter options" instead of pushing through.

The mind virus is amazingly efficient at sucking the energy out of any initiative.

By the time you're done thinking, researching, and planning, you're exhausted and you don't have any energly left to actually do anything. 

Now, what's the cure?

First of all you have to acknowledge that "working smarter instead of harder" is a lie.

It's a beautiful fantasy that's used by people to give entertaining TED talks and sell books.

But in the real world, the only way to discover smarter ways to do things it through a shitload of hard work. 

Not on a whiteboard, not in a spreadsheet, not in a book, but in the real world.

Here's an example. When we started our [agency](https://sales.co), we could have spent a ton of time thinking about our ideal customers. Who exactly do we want to work with? Who's getting the most value out of our services? Who's the easiest to work with? Who's the most profitable?

But all of that would have been a waste of time.

The only way to find out is to work with as many different clients as humany possible and then organically narrow down your focus.

That's the hard way of doing things. But it's also the only way.

Or say, you want to build a personal brand. Sure, you can spend days crafting content plans, thinking about audience personas, and researching the best distribution channels.

Alternatively, you could simply start putting out as much content as possible. 

Again, hard not smart.

You will always more in the first hours of actually doing something than in any amount of time spent thinking or reading about it.

Most people recognize that looking for shortcuts is generally a waste of time. But somehow the exact same idea has entered through the backdoor in the form of "working smarter instead of harder".

The answer is never more information, a better strategy, a new tool, or some smart hack. 

It's always doing simple things with higher intensity for longer periods of time.
