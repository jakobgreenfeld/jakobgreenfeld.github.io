excerpt:  Focus on one specific process where you can provide amazing value, where your clients are most happy with your work. Then double down on it. Develop a repeatable, teachable process. Focus on that and decline all other work.

* My rating: 4/5
* I do not follow MMA but McGregor is a fascinating character. And there's are awesome scenes in every episode that made me think.


## On Developing Mental Strength

"Don't tell yourself you need to do something and then don't do it. I knew in my head I was saying 'Get up at this time' but I didn't get up at that time. 'Train at this time' but I didn't train at that time. 'Don't drink that' but I drank it. These all just infiltrate my mental strengths. Little defeats instead of wins and they just culminate, so I'm figuring myself out like I never have before."
