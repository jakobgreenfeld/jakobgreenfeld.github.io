Start by talking to people. Shocking, I know.

Reach out to everyone in your network who might benefit from your services.

Reach out to strangers. What company might buy your services? Then hunt down the contact info of the most relevant decision-maker you can find and reach out to them.

Offer to work for free.

Be transparent and honest about your intentions. Tell them you are trying to build a portfolio and you are willing to work for free in exchange for a testimonial if they are happy with your work.

Once you figure out how to deliver value, start charging.

Keep reaching out to people in your network and strangers.

But shift your focus towards fullfillment.

No amount of marketing or sales will save you if you can't promise the results you are promising to your clients.

So first of all, figure out how to deliver the absolute best results you can deliver, given the [agency game](/agency-games) you have chosen to play.

This will be the foundation for everything else that follows.

It is definitely possible to build an agency on a shaky foundation. But eventually things will come crashing down. Client's will leave. Lead inflow will dry up. You will burn out.

So it's better to make sure you got the fundamentals right after you've secured some cashflow.

Another benefit is that once you figure out fulfillment, sales and marketing will be so much easier. You will have testimonials you can leverage to build trust and clients will refer you new clients.

Once you have figured out fulfillment, it's time to focus on sales. Figure out a repeatable sales process that allows you attract and close new clients predictably.

Then it's time to focus on building a team.

You might have already made a hire or two at this point to keep up with fullfillment. But now it's time to get serious and build a proper team and hiring process.

Again, the correct order of things is key. If your fulfillment sucks, clients will churn and you will have to fire team members once cashflow dries up.

Manageable churn plus a predictable sales process are essential for proper capacity planning.

Once you've figured out a repeatable process to hire team members when you need them and keep them motivated, it's time to focus on marketing.

This is really the cherry on top and a ton of agencies strive with basically zero marketing.

So that's the playbook in a nutshell.

There is some overlap between the different stages. Sales should never stop unless you absolutely can't handle any more clients. And you should always be on the lookout for new team members.

But the main focus should move from sales to fulfillment to sales to your team to marketing.
