I’ve talked about agency-expanding experiments [before](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/invisible-scripts). I use the term to describe things you can do but normally wouldn’t. They are ways to catapult you out of autopilot mode, help you become friends with [The Resistance](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/founder-patterns#the-resistance), and increase your [agency](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/founder-patterns#high-agency-vs-low-agency), arguably the [most important personality trait](https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1068238562443841538). 

Here’s an ever-growing list of my favorite agency expanding experiments:

- Ask in coffee shop for free glass of tab water
- Buy and wear an unreasonably expensive outfit.
- Go for a walk in a dark forest alone.
- Go for a walk on a graveyard. At night. Alone.
- Spend a day alone in nature
- Go on a trip to a foreign country alone.
- Hire a coach/tutor (fitness, coding, entrepreneurship, whatever)
- Go to a local cafe to read a book.
- Host small virtual gathering or conference on topic I care about
- Host small offline gathering or conference on topic I care about
- Ask a stranger for help.
- Send a message to 5 people you lost contact with. Check their social profile, personal website, and read or watch any content they published. Then share a few thoughts or questions. Or simply ask: *"Hey, hope you're doing well! What are you up to these days?"*
- Write a message to your favorite author.
- Write a message to every single person who’s work you found useful at a given day to say thanks.
- Cancel all of your subscriptions.
- Give a huge tip in a restaurant.
- Book a night in the most expensive hotel in town.
- Book a night in a hostel dorm.
- Go to the most expensive restaurant in town.
- Go to the shadiest part of town and join the kids there for a match of basketball/football.
- Give a stranger a compliment.
- Dress up, use perfume, make your hair, on a day you’re not meeting anyone or even leave the house.
- Ask someone in your local gym for help.
- Select all emails in your email inbox and put them into the archive. (All truly important messages are sent twice anyway.)
- Hire an accountability coach.
- Organize a local football match/basketball match.
- Hire a personal assistant to handle general tasks for you.
