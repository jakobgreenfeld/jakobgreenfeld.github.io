I haven’t made much progress recently. 

My biggest mistake? 

I didn't focus. 

It’s painfully obvious if you take a step back.

Why the f*ck do I write 3 newsletters?

This makes everything unnecessarily hard.

Quality suffers. 

It’s confusing.

*“You should read Jakob’s newsletter!” “Which one?”*

There’s less buzz, less domain authority, less organic traffic. 

Three sites with a domain authority of 15 are simply not getting the same traffic as one page with a domain authority of 45, even if they contain exactly the same content. 

Instead of building three lists from zero to 5000 subscribers, I could’ve built one list to 50,000 subscribers with the same amount of effort. 

There’s a threshold when a project becomes *a thing*. 

People can feel the buzz. The name keeps popping up everywhere.

Google starts considering it a trustworthy resource.

Getting there is so much harder if you’re not focusing your energy.

Whenever I was doing a marketing experiment, I had to make a decision: do I want to direct people here or there? This costs unnecessary mental energy. 

Sometimes I couldn’t make a decision and ended up doing nothing instead.

I never got clean data on what’s working

I wasn’t able to optimize.

So yes, I’m going to focus from now on. 

I will write just one newsletter every week. 

I'm going to think out loud about the inner game of entrepreneurship just like I do in this text. 

I will share all the patterns and tactics I uncover in my studies of successsfull founders and businesses. 

It will be exactly the newsletter I’d love to read myself. 

It’s going to be awesome.
