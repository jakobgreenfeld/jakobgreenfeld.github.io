A ton of successful people love to talk about the benefits of contemplative practices like meditation, journaling, and therapy.

But what's often not talked about is that they only got into this stuff after they had already made it.

And that's not very surprising. 

Once you've reached a level of success where you no longer have to worry about money, you have a lot more time to think about the deeper questions in life. And contemplative practices are a great way to do that and find some peace of mind.

The downside is that self awareness kills your self delusion. And self delusion is an incredibly powerful tool.

Especially for founders, a certain level of self delusion is like a superpower. 

If you truly understood all of your shortcomings and had a full picture of what other people had already tried and failed at, you would most likely never ever start.

As a founder, you need big cave art energy.
