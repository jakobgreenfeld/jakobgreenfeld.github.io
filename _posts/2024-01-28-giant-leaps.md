On my flight to Vienna yesterday I watched Race to the Summit on Netflix.

It's a documentary about two guys rivalry to set speed records on the Swiss Alps' great north faces.

Despite many people trying it was only in 1938 that the north face of the Eiger was first climbed.

It took a whole team multiple days to do it.

In the 60's it took the best climbers around 18 hours.

In the 80's someone managed to do it in 8 hours and 30 minutes.

The current record? 

2 hours 22 minutes 50 seconds.

Solo. 

Without any ropes.

Now what's interesting about this development is that only a few years after Ueli Steck shattered all previous records by climbing the Eiger north face in 2 hours 47 minutes, [another guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Arnold) comes around and does it 20 minutes faster. 

And then Ueli went back and did it even faster.

This pattern shows up everywhere.

But why?

* Outside the box, make frame, break frame. Different approach.
* Technology opens new doors.
* Mental limitations -> always seems impossible until done. there's usually some kernel of truth in cringy quotes like that. "Illusion of explanatory depth". Why no new einstein. Has good thoughts on that too https://web.getmatter.com/entry/4836761
