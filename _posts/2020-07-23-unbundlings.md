Society moves in waves.  It always starts with lots of separate things. Then they get bundled. After a while, more and more people start to realize that the bundled solution is too bloated and not specific enough for their needs. [This is when an unbundling happens.](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/21/office-messaging-and-verbs)

Unbundlings always represent a multitude of business opportunities. Below I'll list several examples of unbundlings that have happened in the past, some that are happening right now, and a few speculations on what might be unbundled next. 

While going through the following examples, ask yourself:  What aspect hasn't been unbundled yet? What could be unbundled in a better way?

## What's Next?

Now that we have some understanding of how unbundlings look like in practice, it's time to ask: what's the next big thing that will get unbundled?

A few suggestions:

- Twitter? (Especially its DM function, e.g., along the lines of what Earn.com tried. But also the "News-Feed" aspect, the "Life-Updates" aspect, the RSS-Feed aspect, etc.)
- Ebay? Amazon? (See Etsy, Shopify)
- Offices? (See Slack, Zoom, [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/), [WIP.chat](https://wip.chat/))

I'd love to hear on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld) what unbundlings you've observed in the past and which you predict for the future!
