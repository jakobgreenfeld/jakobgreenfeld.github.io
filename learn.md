I'm teaching to learn and experiment with different formats for micro courses. 

* No boring slideshows. 
* No high-flying theories that only look good on the surface but don't actually work in practice. 
* No attempts to be comprehensive.

Instead:

* Behind-the-scenes recordings.
* Daily exercises and bite-sized, actionable lessons. 
* Just the 20% of information that are responsible for 80% of all results.

I’m not a world-renowned expert in any of the topics listed below. Most likely, I’m just one or two steps ahead of you. 

But that’s a good thing. Experts have long forgotten what it’s like to be a beginner. Hence it’s much better to learn from someone just one step ahead of you who still remembers vividly all the problems a beginners struggles with. 


**Scraping the Web for Fun and Profit**

In the past 12 months, I built 5 profitable businesses and made over $100,000 leveraging my web scraping skills.

In this self-directed, non-linear course, I'm for the first time sharing everything I know.

You’ll learn:

* The basics of web scraping using Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup.
* Effective strategies to speed up your scraping scripts and reduce error rates.
* How to avoid getting blocked.
* Advanced screen scraping methods that will allow you to scrape websites that require a login.
* How to reverse engineer browser requests.
* How to find undocumented APIs and use them to extract information that's not publicly available.
* What I've learned about building and selling data products.

There are zero boring slide shows in the course, just behind-the-scenes recordings of me solving real-world problems and explaining what I do.
