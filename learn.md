**Scraping the Web for Fun and Profit**

In the past 12 months, I built 5 profitable businesses and made over $100,000 leveraging my web scraping skills.

In this self-directed, non-linear course, I'm for the first time sharing everything I know.

Youâ€™ll learn:

* The basics of web scraping using Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup.
* Effective strategies to speed up your scraping scripts and reduce error rates.
* How to avoid getting blocked.
* Advanced screen scraping methods that will allow you to scrape websites that require a login.
* How to reverse engineer browser requests.
* How to find undocumented APIs and use them to extract information that's not publicly available.
* What I've learned about building and selling data products.

There are zero boring slide shows in the course, just behind-the-scenes recordings of me solving real-world problems and explaining what I do.
