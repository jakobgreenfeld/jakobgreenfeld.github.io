Unfortunately, most of the time practices and principles are only shared by influencers. If you want to improve a certain aspect of your life, this is hardly the best place to look for inspiration. 

Influencer have to push new things regularly. How else could they sell new stuff and produce further content? 

And don't be fooled, this phenomenon is not fitness-niche specific. 

For example, there are the productivity influencers who push every other week a new todo app, notes tool, or productivity system as something that, they promise, finally changes everything and gives you the 10x results you're looking for. Similar observations can be made for marketing influencers, programming influencer, and, really, any other kind of influencer.

A second reason why experts are rarely who you should ask for advice. You typically get much better advice from someone who was in a similar siutation like you recently and is now just one step ahead of you. Someone like this still remembers all the problems you're going to face and what kind of things are truly relevant to you. 


Encourage more regular people to share what they do. This allows you to reflect on your own processes and get feedback from others.

Curate valuable writeups from regular people and give them the attention they deserve.
