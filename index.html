<h1>Hi, I'm Jakob!</h1>

<p>I am the founder of a series of humble online businesses (<a href="https://newsletterspy.io">Newsletter Spy</a>, <a href="https://abandonedassets.io">Abandoned Assets</a>, <a href="https://undertheradar.io">Under the Radar</a>, <a href="https://tweetsondemand.com">Tweets on Demand</a>), author of the <a href="https://opportunities.so">Opportunities newsletter</a>, and host of the <a href="https://businessbrainstorms.com">Business Brainstorms podcast</a>.</p>

<p>This site hosts all of my writing on entrepreneurship, self-education, marketing, and more.</p>

<p>My big theme for this year is to learn <a href="/time-to-win">how to win at the Great Online Game</a>.</p>

<p>Previously I graduated with PhD in theoretical particle physics and then decided carve out my own path by pursuing a <a href="/mba">Bootstrap MBA</a>. </p>

<p>Finally, if you're a curious intelligent person, you should definitely join the 5000+ other people on my personal newsletter. It’s one email a week with everything interesting I’ve learned, read or found.</p>
