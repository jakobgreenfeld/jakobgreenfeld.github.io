<h1>Hi, I'm Jakob</h1>

<p>I know that it's conventional to write a few lines about yourself to give visitors like you an idea of what they can expect to find here. But I'm always hesistant to use labels like "writer", "programmer", or "entrepreneur". They are used so commonly for all  kinds of different things that they've become almost meaningless. Moreover, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html">"the more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you"</a>.</p>

<p>And looking at what people do is anyway far more interesting than what they say. So here are a few things I've been working on recently. </p>
