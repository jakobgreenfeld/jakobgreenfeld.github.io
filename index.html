<h1>Hi, I'm Jakob!</h1>

<p>My big theme for this year is to learn <a href="/time-to-win">how to win at the great online game</a>.</p>

<p>Previously I finished a <a href="/mba">Bootstrap MBA</a> learning experiment. </p>




<p>Finally, if you're a curious intelligent person, you should definitely join the 5000+ other people on my newsletter. It’s one email a week with everything interesting I’ve learned, read or found.</p>

Enjoy,
Jakob
