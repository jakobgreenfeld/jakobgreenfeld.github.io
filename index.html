<h1>Hi, I'm Jakob!</h1>


<p>I recently finished a <a href="/mba">Bootstrap MBA</a> and now started a new learning experiment. </p>

<p>My new goal is to learn <a href="/time-to-win">how to win at the great online game</a>.</p>

<p>Every week I send a short email with everthing I learned. Join here:</p>

Enjoy,
Jakob
