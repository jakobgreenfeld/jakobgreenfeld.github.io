Most books are written by people near the end of their journey. At this point, they've usually already forgotten what problems beginners are facing. Hence I'm writing as I go along and still learn new things every day. I certainly don't have all the answers. But I try to be as helpful as possible by writing down all the things I wished I had known earlier. And I'll update all articles here whenever I change my mind on something.
