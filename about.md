Some information about you!

### More Information

Why I Write

- Writing helps me clarify my own thinking. For example, henever I write down how I do something, I start to wonder why I'm  doing it this way and not another. This motivates me to try out alternatives and improve the way I approach things. 
- Most people spend most of their time doing things they don't really enjoy for reasons they can't articulate. We all work far too much. Mimetic traps, bullshit job. It's all signalling.
- There's this vicious circle of people complicating things to profit and beginners believing they need to do complicated stuff because otherwise they're not serious enough. 


Mantras

- "Do good things and talk about it."
- "Take the risks and you’ll get the payoffs. Learn from your mistakes until you succeed. It’s that simple." - Bobby Flay
- "Almost no one is evil. Almost everything is broken."
- "Strong convictions, loosely held."
- "My rrole in life is not to be on top of things. My role is to get to the bottom of things."

Beliefs

- Not working out is silly. An hour at the gym nets you more than an hour of productivity throughout the rest of your day.
- Refined carbs and vegetable oils are the devil. 
- It's much smarter to learn from someone one step ahead of you than from an expert.
