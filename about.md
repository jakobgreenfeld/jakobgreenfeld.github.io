Some information about you!

### More Information

A few things that motivate me to write:

- Writing helps me clarify my own thinking. For example, henever I write down how I do something, I start to wonder why I'm  doing it this way and not another. This motivates me to try out alternatives and improve the way I approach things. 
- Most people spend most of their time doing things they don't really enjoy for reasons they can't articulate. We all work far too much. Mimetic traps, bullshit job. It's all signalling.
- There's this vicious circle of people complicating things to profit and beginners believing they need to do complicated stuff because otherwise they're not serious enough. 


Mantras

- "Do good things and talk about it."
- "Take the risks and you’ll get the payoffs. Learn from your mistakes until you succeed. It’s that simple." - Bobby Flay
- "Almost no one is evil. Almost everything is broken."
- "Strong convictions, loosely held."
