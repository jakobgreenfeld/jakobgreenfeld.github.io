Why I Write

- Writing helps me clarify my own thinking. For example, whenever I write down how I do something, I start to wonder why I'm  doing it this way and not differently. This motivates me to try out alternatives and improve the way I approach things. 
- Most people spend most of their time doing things they don't really enjoy for reasons they can't articulate. We all work far too much. We all fall into mimetic traps, do bullshit job and all kinds of other crazy stuff solely for the purpose of signalling. I'm hoping to make more people aware of these problems.
- There's this vicious circle of people complicating things to profit and beginners believing they need to do complicated stuff because otherwise they're not serious enough. I'm hoping to make more people aware that most things can be accomplished in a simple way.


Mantras

- "Do good things and talk about it."
- "Take the risks and you’ll get the payoffs. Learn from your mistakes until you succeed. It’s that simple." - Bobby Flay
- "Almost no one is evil. Almost everything is broken."
- "My role in life is not to be on top of things but to get to the bottom of things."
- "Strong convictions, loosely held."

Convictions

- It's much smarter to learn from someone one step ahead of you than from an expert.
- Not working out is silly. An hour at the gym nets you more than an hour of productivity throughout the rest of your day.
- Refined carbs and vegetable oils are the devil.
