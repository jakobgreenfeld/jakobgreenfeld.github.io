I've recently started helping people by offering feedback, advice, and sometimes really just an outsider's perspective. 

Here are a few things I can help you with:

* Running an Agency: Struggling with managing your team? Looking for better strategies to scale your agency? Need some brutally honest feedback on your business model?
* Sales: Struggling to increase your sales? Looking for better strategies to improve your sales performance? Need some brutally honest feedback on your sales process?
* Cold Email: Struggling to get responses from your cold emails? Looking for better ways to write effective cold emails? Need some brutally honest feedback on your email drafts? Unsure what exactly moves the needle?
* AI and Automations: Struggling to automate your business processes? Looking for better ways to utilize AI in your business? Need some brutally honest feedback on your current automation setup? Just looking for some fresh ideas what can be automated?
* Business ideas: Struggling to decide what idea to pursue? Looking for feedback on a specific idea? Unsure if you should sell a project?
* Newsletter growth: Struggling to grow your newsletter? Looking for better ways to monetize it? Need some brutally honest audit of your recent emails?
* Twitter growth: Struggling to get more followers? Looking for better ways to come up with content ideas? Need some brutally honest feedback on your recent tweets?
* Writing: Struggling with writer's block? Looking for new ways to find readers? Need some honest feedback?
* Web scraping: Struggling to scrape data from a specific site? No idea where to best get data for a project? Confused about how to set up a specific automation?

Here's how it works:

* You can submit your questions in written form or by recording a short video. I wil then answer them asynchonously by recording a 10-20 minute, private video, packed with personalized advice, ideas, and feedback.

## What people are saying

"I'm constantly debating which business ideas to pursue. Getting a fresh perspective is so valuable. Your personalized critique helped me clarify my own thoughts. You've nudged me towards one of my better ideas, something actually worth pursuing. Can't imagine a better use of $29." - [John Speed](https://twitter.com/John_Speed)

"The amount of value I got from my microconsulting purchase was unbelievable. When you're learning how to build a business, you spend so much time trying to read and find information online, but Jakob used his already acquired knowledge and experience to point me in the right direction for my business. He gave me advice on how to better my landing page, gave me ideas on how to experiment with each step in my funnel, gave me ideas on how to market on social media and much more. This purchase will save you so much time. It was $29 but easily hundreds of dollars worth of value." - [Jen](https://twitter.com/raff_jen)

## Why me?

*  I've grown [the agency](https://sales.co) I co-founded to 7-figures in revenue in less than 12 months, all with a remote team, healthy margins, and without losing my mind.
* At my agency, team members are able to do what at other agencies takes at least 3 people, all thanks to AI + automations.
* My agency has helped 100+ companies ranging from YC startups, Inc. 5000 companies, to award-winning agencies improve their sales function.
* I've managed hundreds of cold email campaigns, contacting thousands of decision makers, generating millions in pipeline.
* Every week I'm running systmatic cold email experiments to understand what is working right now.
* I've built and sold multiple profitable businesses. I've also been brainstorming, researching, and sharing business ideas [every week](https://brainstorms.substack.com) for more than two years now.
* I've grown 5 newsletters to 1000+ subscribers and one to 10,000+ subscribers. I've experimented with dozens of growth channels, formats, and monetization methods. Along the way I learned a ton about what's working and what isn't.
* I've grown my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld) to 12,000+ followers and made countless invaluable connections along the way. I've done this by authentically sharing my journey, not through cheap growth hacks. 
* My [essays](/articles) are regularly read by tens of thousands of people. 
* I built 5 profitable businesses and made over $100,000 leveraging my web scraping skills. I'm also teaching a popular [web scraping course](https://jakobgreenfeld.gumroad.com/l/scraping).

I'll be an honest third-party observer who won't pull punches.

I love talking with early founders and people who are just starting to figure things out. 

I don‚Äôt claim to have all the answers and I still have a lot to learn, but I‚Äôm happy to share what I‚Äôve learned along the way.



## Why I'm offering this

I've been getting more and more emails from people asking for advice, feedback, and brainstorming help. 

While I always love helping people, my time is obviously limited. So usually I prefer writing blog posts that are potentially read by thousands of people and can keep providing value for many years. 

But at the same time, there are many specific questions or problems where it doesn't make sense to write a blog post. 

The second reason why I've decided to offer asynchronous micro consulting sessions is that this is something I wish someone had offered this when I was just starting out. 

I'm convinced that even just some short feedback from someone one or two steps ahead, could've saved me a lot of time and money.

But like most people, I never reached out to people that could've helped me. 

After all, everyone seems super busy and there was nothing I could offer to them. 

So by making things more transactional, I hope to break down this barrier. 

I definitely would've been happy to pay for someone's time but it feels kind of weird to just offer this out of the blue. 

So this micro consulting offer is really just something I wished had existed when I started my journey.

As <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jakobgreenfeld</a> says it&#39;s more about connecting than revenue and counter-intuitively makes is easier for people to ask questions because there&#39;s a structure and clear expectations around doing so. <a href="https://t.co/LDD3tFCMnO">https://t.co/LDD3tFCMnO</a></p>&mdash; Cathy Raffaele üçè ü•î (@cathyraffaele) <a href="https://twitter.com/cathyraffaele/status/1578255521483669507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Fine Print

This is an experiment and I have absolutely no idea how long I will be offering this. 

If I feel like I'm not able to help you, you'll get a 100% refund. 

For asynchronous videos, I expect to dedicate 60 minutes to research and provide a video of my findings. 

Promised delivery within one week. Target will be faster, but the promise is one week.
